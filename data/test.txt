  Scene 1

Music plays and wiggly worm appears on the screen pans back to include Smeagols face.

Shows two hobbits fishing in a boat.

 	 
DEAGOL:	Oh Smeagol Ive got one! (laughs) Ive got a fish Smeagol, Smeagol! (laughs hysterically) 
 
SMEAGOL:	Pull it in! Go on, go on, go on, pull it in! 
 
DEAGOL:	Arrghh! (falls in the water) 
 
SMEAGOL:	Deagol! 
 
Deagol gets pulled along the bottom of the river by a fish on his hook. He lets go of the rod and spots something shiny buried in the silt and grabs it. He crawls up onto the grassy bank spluttering and coughing.
When he recovers he opens his hand and stares mesmerised at the shiny ring, which lies there covered in mud. He fingers the ring and ominous music plays. 
 
SMEAGOL:	Deagol! 
 
Smeagol runs up to him laughing 
 
SMEAGOL:	Deagol! 
 
Smeagol spots the ring in Deagols hand and his happy expression changes and he also becomes mesmerised by it. 
 
SMEAGOL:	Give us that! Deagol my love 
 
Deagol turns around and looks at him. 
 
DEAGOL:	Why? 
 
SMEAGOL:	Because (he puts his arm around Deagol) its my birthday and I wants it. 
 
Smeagol grabs for the ring but Deagol snatches it away. They look closely at each other and Smeagol smiles at Deagol but tries to snatch the ring again. They circle with faces close to each other. Deagol holds the ring behind him. Smeagol tries to snatch it and pry it from his fingers. They begin to struggle Smeagol trying to get the ring away from Deagol. He pushes Smeagol on the chin, forcing him away. Smeagol retaliates and bites Deagol on the wrist. Deagol turns and runs away from him and Smeagol jumps onto his back making him fall over and drop the ring. They both scrabble for the fallen ring, but Deagol manages to get hold of it. He turns around and attacks Smeagol, grabbing him by the throat with one hand. Smeagol struggles but manages to push him off, grabbing Deagol with both hands by the throat. He forces him to the ground and holds him tightly by the throat strangling him. Deagol dies.

Smeagol reaches over and takes the ring from his hand. He holds it in his own hands admiring its beauty. 
 
SMEAGOL:	 My precious. 
 
Smeagol vanishes and the  Scene changes to one amongst rocks he is grimacing, dirty and ragged.
 
SMEAGOL:	They cursed us
 
GOLLUM:	Murderer
 
SMEAGOL:	Murderer they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. (hugs himself biting his thumb. He opens his filthy hand to show the ring.) 
 
SMEAGOL:	Gollum Gollum Gollum (holds his throat crying) and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone. 
 
He grabs a fish out of the water 
 
SMEAGOL:	and cool, so nice for feet and we only wish to catch a fish (he bites the fish in his filthy teeth) so juicy sweet. 
 
Fades out and back in showing Smeagol much deteriorated looking mad. Shows him crawling into a dark cave. 
 
SMEAGOL:	And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees and the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. 
 
Smeagol closes his eyes and when he opens them again he has changed into Gollum. 
 
GOLLUM:	My precious!

   Scene 2

 	 
Change to a grey morning with barren trees. Picture pans back to include a concrete culvert with Sam asleep and Frodo sitting up looking into nothing with staring eyes. He fiddles with the chain around his neck and grimaces. He pulls the ring out surreptitiously watching Sam making sure he doesnt see. He admires the ring turning it in his fingers. He hears a sound and glances up, tucking the ring away quickly in his clothes.
Gollum appears from above hanging upside down and looking at them. 
 

GOLLUM:	Wake up! (he jumps down) Wake up! (he prods Sam) Wake up sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once. 
 
He scampers away and Sam sits up. 
 
SAM:	Havent you had any sleep Mr Frodo? 
 
Frodo shakes his head looking at him. 
 
SAM:	And Ive gone and had too much. (He stands and looks out of the culvert) It must be getting late. 
 
FRODO:	No, it isnt. It isnt midday yet. (He peers around) The days are growing darker. 
 
The ground shakes and the Volcano spurts fire in the distance. 
 
GOLLUM:	Come on! Must go! No time! 
 
SAM:	Not before Mr Frodos had something to eat. 
 
GOLLUM:	No time to lose silly! 
 
Sam ignores Gollum and turns back into the culvert. He goes into his bag for food. He offers a lembas wrapping to Frodo. 
 
SAM:	Here.
 
Frodo takes it eagerly. 
 
FRODO:	What about you? 
 
SAM:	Oh no, Im not hungry, leastways not for lembas bread. 
 
FRODO:	Sam! 
 
SAM:	Oh alright, but we dont have that much left. We have to be careful or we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. Ive rationed it, there should be enough. 
 
Frodo eats. 
 
FRODO:	For what? 
 
SAM:	The journey home. 
 
 Scene changes and shows the Hobbits walking, following Gollum into the trees. 
 
GOLLUM:	Come Hobbitses, very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry. 
 
They follow him through the dreary landscape.

  Scene 3

 	 
 Scene cuts to Gandalf, Eomer, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Theoden all riding through the forest. Looking warily around.
 TITLES

Picture pans away from the forest to the ruins of Isengard. Distant laughter is heard. 
 

MERRY:	Its good. Definitely from the Shire. (Shows Merry smoking a pipe.) Longbottom leaf eh? 
 
PIPPIN:	uhh huh (nods in agreement, very happy and smoking himself) I feel like Im back at the Green Dragon. 
 
MERRY:	Mmmm (eating) Green Dragon! 
 
PIPPIN:	A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard days work. 
 
MERRY:	Only, (looking very glassy eyed) youve never done a hard days work. 
 
Pippin nods and laughs agreeing with him. 
Sounds of horses attract their attention. 
They see Gandalf riding out of the trees. 
 
PIPPIN:	Ahaha! (he salutes them with his mug) 
 
Merry Stands. 
 
MERRY:	Welcome, my lords to Isengard! 
 
GIMLI:	You young rascals. A merry hunt youve led us on and now we find you feasting and  and smoking! 
 
PIPPIN:	(slurred) We are sitting on a field of victory enjoying a few well earned comforts (whilst eating a sandwich.) The salted pork is particularly good. 
 
GIMLI:	Salted pork 
 
GANDALF:	Hobbits! 
 
MERRY:	Were under orders from Treebeard whos taken over management of Isengard.


  Scene 4

 	 
 Scene changes to the riders approaching Orthanc with the Hobbits on board with them. 
 
TREEBEARD:	Hoooom, young master Gandalf, Im glad youve come. Wood and water, stock and stone I can master, but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in his tower
 
ARAGORN:	 (looking up at the tower) Show yourself. 
 
GANDALF:	Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous. 
 
GIMLI:	Well then lets just have his head and be done with it. 
 
GANDALF:	No, we need him alive. We need him to talk. 
 
SARUMAN:	You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?
Can we not have peace you and I?
 
THEODEN:	We shall have peace. We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows we shall have peace! 
 
SARUMAN:	Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad Dr itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards! 
 
GANDALF:	Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemys counsel. 
 
SARUMAN:	So you have come here for information. I have some for you. 
(Holds up the palantir and looks into it) 
Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon. 
(Gandalf rides forward) 
You are all going to die! But you know this dont you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. 
(Aragorn looks at him) 
Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death. 
 
GIMLI:	Ive heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob! 
 
Legolas reaches for an arrow.
 
GANDALF:	No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared! 
 
SARUMAN:	Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it! 
(Directs a bolt of fire at Gandalf which he survives with no ill effects) 
 
GANDALF:	Saruman.. your staff is broken! 
 
Sarumans staff bursts asunder! 
Grima Wormtongue appears behind Saruman. 
 
THEODEN:	Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down. 
 
Grima looks like he going to come down. 
 
SARUMAN:	A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires! 
 
THEODEN:	Grima. Come down! Be free of him! 
 
SARUMAN:	Free? He will never be free!
 
GRIMA:	No! 
 
Saruman turns around to Grima! 
 
SARUMAN:	Get down cur! (slaps him to the ground) 
 
GRIMA:	Ah! 
 
GANDALF:	Saruman! You were deep in the enemys counsel. Tell us what you know! 
 
Saruman turns around to face Gandalf. 
Grima pulls a knife out behind Saruman. 
 
SARUMAN:	You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be decided. I will not be held prisoner here! 
 
Grima rises up behind Saruman and attacks him with the knife, stabbing him twice in the back. Legolas aims an arrow at Grima who falls shot in the heart. Saruman falls from the tower and is impaled on a great wheel below. 
 
GANDALF:	Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike. 
 
The water wheel turns and Saruman disappears beneath the water head first. The Palantir drops from his hand into the water. 
 
TREEBEARD:	The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. 
(Pippin sees the Palantir and dismounts) 
Young trees. Wild trees. 
 
ARAGORN:	Pippin! (as Pippin moves towards the Palantir) 
 
Pippin looks into the Palantir and it holds his gaze for a minute. 
 
TREEBEARD:	Bless my bark! 
 
GANDALF:	Peregrin Took. Ill take that my lad! Quickly now! 
 
Pippin hands the Palantir to him and he wraps it up. He looks sheepish at Gandalf and watches him intently as he turns away.

  Scene 5

 	 
 Scene on the plains of Rohan follows riders towards Edoras. Picture pans into the Golden Hall with Eowyn standing on the parapet. 

Changes to Eowyn offering a goblet of wine to Theoden as she kneels in front of him. She retires behind him. Theoden offers the goblet in toast to the people of Rohan .
 
THEODEN:	Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.
 
He offers up the goblet. 
 
THEODEN:	Hail the victorious dead
 
PEOPLE:	Hail! (they return his toast)
 
Aragorn hesitates and thinks of them before he drinks.
 Scene changes to the people feasting at long tables. Cuts to Eomer.
 
EOMER:	No pauses, (cuts to show Legolas and Gimli) no spills.
 
GIMLI:	And no regurgitation! (He lifts the tankard to his mouth general laughter)
 
LEGOLAS:	So its a drinking game?
 
ROHIRRIM:	Aye! (laughing)
 
GIMLI:	Last one standing wins heh heh heh!
 
He drinks his tankard in one go!
 
GENERAL SHOUT:	Lets drink to Victory! To Victory!
 
Cuts back to Gimli finishing his drink in one go.
Legolas begins to drink from his tankard. 
Cuts across to Eowyn with a goblet in her hand approaching, smiling. Aragorn approaches her and takes the offered goblet.
 
EOWYN:	West Aragorn, hal
 
He takes the goblet and drinks. She smiles at him and he looks intensely at her. With a little smile he walks away. 
Theoden enters the  Scene and watches Aragorn walking away. He turns to Eowyn.
 
THEODEN:	I am very happy for you. He is an honourable man.
 
EOWYN:	You are both honourable men. 
 
Theoden nods slightly.
 
THEODEN:	It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
 
He looks down and she looks concernedly at him.
 
THEODEN:	Ach, dont listen to me. You are young and tonight is for you.
 
She smiles.
Cuts back to Gimli drinking another tankard of ale and across to Legolas also downing another tankard. 
Gimli farts! 
 
GIMLI:	Heh heh heh heh (looking the worse for wear) Here, here. (he takes another tankard) Raaar its the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women haha (burps and drinks some more)
 
LEGOLAS:	I feel something. (he looks at his fingers and Eomer raises an eyebrow) A slight tingle in my fingers. I think its affecting me. (looks concerned)
 
GIMLI:	heh heh heh (slurring his words) what did I say? He cant hold his liquor. 
 
His eyes are crossed and he sits quiet for a moment, then keels over backwards off his stool. Legolas watches him fall, raises his eyebrows and looks over at Eomer.
 
LEGOLAS:	Game over!
 
The  Scene cuts to Merry and Pippin singing.
 
MERRY and PIPPIN:	Oh you can search far and wide, You can drink the whole town dry, 
(they dance on the table kicking their feet against each other) 
But youll never find a beer so brown, But youll never find a beer so brown, 
As the one we drink in our hometown, As the one we drink in our hometown.
(they stamp on the table) 
You can drink your fancy ales, You can drink them by the flagon 
(cuts to show Gandalf watching and smiling at them) 
But the only brew for the brave and true, 
(Pippin stops and looks at Gandalf and hesitates)
 
MERRY:	Pippin! 
 
Pippin turns back to Merry and continues with the song.
 
MERRY and PIPPIN:	Comes from the Green Dragon!
 
Laughter and applause. Shows Gandalf clapping and smiling. Aragorn walks up and joins him. 
 
MERRY:	(off camera) Thank you! I win!
 
ARAGORN:	(whilst watching) No news of Frodo?
 
GANDALF:	No word. Nothing.
 
ARAGORN:	We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
 
GANDALF:	(turning to him) Do we know that?
 
ARAGORN:	(looks at him a moment) What does your heart tell you?
 
GANDALF:	(with a small smile) That Frodo is alive. Yes yes hes alive. 


  Scene 6
 	 
 Scene shows Sam asleep wrapped up in his cloak amongst some rocks. A voice off camera.
 
GOLLUM:	Too risky. Too risky. (cuts to Gollum also asleep) Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both! (wakes up suddenly) 
 
SMEAGOL:	No!
 
GOLLUM:	Sshh, quiet, mustnt wake them. Mustnt ruin it now. 
(climbs down from his sleeping place)
 
SMEAGOL:	But they knows, (as he moves over to a lake) they knows, they suspects us!
 
Cuts to Smeagols reflection in the water.
 
GOLLUM:	Whats it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve?
 
SMEAGOL:	No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them. Dead!
 
GOLLUM:	And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again! 
(flashes back to the first  Scene where Smeagol has Deagol by the throat) 
Its ours! Ours!
 
SMEAGOL:	We must get the precious! We must get it back!
 
GOLLUM:	Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her!
 
SMEAGOL:	We lead them to the winding stair.
 
GOLLUM:	Yes, the stairs and then?
 
SMEAGOL:	Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel.
 
GOLLUM:	And when they go in, theres no coming out. Shes always hungry. She always needs to feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses.
 
SMEAGOL:	And they doesnt taste very nice, does they Precious?
 
GOLLUM:	No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. 
(cuts to Sams face as he wakes up) 
Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes 
(Sam is listening) then we will find it.
 
SMEAGOL:	And take it for Meee!
 
GOLLUM:	For us.
 
SMEAGOL:	Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! 
(he throws a pebble in the water as he says it and Sams reflection appears out of the ripples)
 
SAM:	You treacherous little toad! 
 
Sam punches him waking Frodo who scrambles out of his blanket. Sam chases Gollum, jumps on him and grabs his throat. Gollum screams.
 
GOLLUM:	No, no! Master!
 
FRODO:	No Sam! Leave him alone! (he pulls Sam off)
 
SAM:	I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.
 
GOLLUM:	Never! Smeagol wouldnt hurt a fly! 
(he rubs his head and sees blood on his fingers) 
Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!
 
SAM:	You miserable little maggot! Ill stove your head in! 
 
He advances on Gollum grabbing at him. Gollum runs off, Frodo pulls Sam back.
 
FRODO:	Sam!
 
SAM:	Call me a liar? Youre a liar!
 
Gollum tries to hide behind a tree.
 
GOLLUM:	Waaaah! 
 
FRODO:	If you scare him off then we are lost!
 
SAM:	I dont care! I cant do it Mr Frodo! I wont wait around for him to kill us!
 
FRODO:	Im not sending him away.
 
Gollum cowers behind the tree.
 
SAM:	You dont see it do you? Hes a villain.
 
FRODO:	We cant do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.
 
SAM:	Im on your side Mr Frodo
 
FRODO:	I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol.
 
Gollum runs to Frodo looking scared. Frodo takes him by the hand but as he leads him away, Gollum turns and smirks at Sam. Sam glares after him, nodding his head slightly.
 	 
  Scene 7

 	 
 Scene moves to Gimli snoring. The floor of the hall is scattered with sleeping bodies. Aragorn moves stealthily across the room and goes out through the door. The camera dwells on Pippin who turns over and wakes up. He tries to sleep obviously having an inward struggle with himself.
 Scene changes to the main hall where Eowyn sleeps in the centre of the room next to the fire. Aragorn walks past her to the fire. He moves the logs around to encourage it to burn, he looks at her sleeping and walks over to her to pull her dress down to her ankle and her collar up to her neck
.

EOWYN:	(with her eyes closed) What time is it?
 
ARAGORN	Not yet dawn. 
 
He strokes the fur on her collar and withdraws his hand. She grabs his hand as he draws away. He turns back and looks at her.
 
EOWYN:	I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn ( he stoops down next to her and she looks at him upset) 
I could only stand there, waiting. (a tear runs down her face.)
 
ARAGORN:	Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can. 
(He clutches her hands and then leaves her. She sleeps)
 
  Scene 8

 	 
Aragorn walks outside, starts to fill his pipe and sees Legolas standing looking at the distance. He walks over to him.
 
LEGOLAS:	The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice
 (he glances at Aragorn.) The eye of the enemy is moving.
 
 Scene changes to Pippin inside. He stirs, gets up and throws back his blanket. He pauses checking everyone is asleep. He walks up the centre of the room.
 
MERRY:	What are you doing?
 
Pippin whirls around guiltily. He looks at Merry then continues with what he was doing. He approaches Gandalf but hesitates when he see his eyes open.
 
MERRY:	Pippin!
 
Pippin waves his hand in front of Gandalfs eyes. They dont move. He is asleep. Pippin looks at the bundle in Gandalfs arms.
 
MERRY:	(sits up and looks at Pippin concerned) Pippin!
 
Pippin ignores him and picks up a jug. Gandalf mutters something in his sleep making Pippin recoil in fear. But he gains more courage and grabs the bundle from Gandalfs arm, replacing it with the jug.
 
MERRY:	Pippin! Are you mad?
 
Pippin puts the bundle on the floor in front of him and Merry and unwraps it.
 
PIPPIN:	I just want to look at it, just one more time.
 
MERRY:	Put it back!
 
Pippin looks into the Palantir, he smiles and puts his hands on it.
 
MERRY:	Pippin! 
 
Pippins smile turns to a frown and an orange glow emerges from the Palantir with a black pupil showing. Pippin's hands fuse onto the Palantir and he begins to shake.
 
MERRY:	No!
 
Pippin shakes and closes his eyes.
 
MERRY:	(worried now watching wide eyed) Pippin!
 
Pippin shakes more and more violently!
Cuts to Legolas outside who turns.
 
LEGOLAS:	He is here!
 
Cuts back to Pippin with his eyes tightly closed.
 
SAURON:	I see you!
 
Pippin screams and stands up with the Palantir stuck in his hands. His mouth is open in a soundless scream!
 
MERRY:	Pippin!
 
The Palantir is surrounded by fire. Pippin falls to the floor seemingly struggling with it.
 
MERRY:	Help! Gandalf help! 
 
Gandalf wakes. Aragorn and Legolas burst into the room. Pippin continues to struggle.
 
MERRY:	Help him!
 
Aragorn takes the Palantir from Pippin, struggles briefly with it and drops it on to the floor. It rolls away. Merry dodges it as it rolls still further.
 
MERRY:	 Pippin!
 
Gandalf runs after the Palantir and throws a blanket over it.
 
GANDALF:	Fool of a Took! 
 
But when he looks Pippin is lying still with his eyes open.
 
GANDALF:	No.
 
He runs to Pippins side, shoving Merry out of the way. He holds Pippins hand, puts his other hand on his forehead and closes his eyes. He mutters something inaudible under his breath and moves his hand to Pippins cheek. Pippin jumps, gasps and wakes up.
 
GANDALF:	Look at me. (Pippin looks at him)
 
PIPPIN:	Gandalf, forgive me! (he closes his eyes again)
 
GANDALF:	Look at me! What did you see? 
 
PIPPIN:	A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead. 
(cuts to fire, a white tree and a tower. Cuts back.) 
The city was burning.
 
GANDALF:	Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
 
PIPPIN:	I saw I saw him! (Gandalfs eyes widen) I could hear his voice in my head.
 
GANDALF:	And what did you tell him? Speak!
 
PIPPIN:	He asked me my name. I didnt answer. He hurt me!
 
GANDALF:	What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? 
(Pippin just looks at Gandalfs face.)
 
 Scene cuts to the main hall the next morning.
 
GANDALF:	There was no lie in Pippins eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains. 
 
The camera cuts to Pippin and Merry and then back to Gandalf.
 
GANDALF:	He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. (cuts to Gimli sighing with relief)
Weve been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemys plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. 
(Camera cuts to Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Theoden and then in to Theoden alone.)
 
GANDALF:	His defeat at Helms Deep showed our enemy one thing. (cuts back to Gandalf) He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth 
(nods at Aragorn the camera stays on Aragorn) 
Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. (cuts to Theoden) He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground (back to Gandalf and then to Aragorn) before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war.
 
THEODEN:	Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor?
 
ARAGORN:	I will go!
 
GANDALF:	No! 
 
ARAGORN:	They must be warned!
 
GANDALF:	They will be. (approaches closely to Aragorn and speaks in a low voice) 
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships. (he turns from him) 
Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith (turns to look at Pippin) and I wont be going alone.
 
 Scene changes to outside Gandalf is hurrying towards the stables with Pippin and Merry running after him.
 
GANDALF:	Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry!
 
PIPPIN:	Where are we going?
 
MERRY:	Why did you look? Why do you always have to look?
 
PIPPIN:	I dont know, I cant help it.
 
MERRY:	You never can!
 
PIPPIN:	Im sorry alright? I wont do it again.
 
MERRY:	Dont you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here.
 
PIPPIN:	And you? Youre coming with me? (Merry walks away) Merry? (turns back to him as he walks)
 
MERRY:	Come on!
 
Gandalf lifts Pippin onto the back of Shadowfax.
 
PIPPIN:	How far is Minas Tirith?
 
GANDALF:	Three days ride as the Nazgl flies. And youd better hope we dont have one of those on our tail.
 
MERRY:	Here, something for the road. (he hands Pippin a leather pouch.)
 
PIPPIN:	The last of the Longbottom Leaf? 
 
MERRY:	I know youve run out. You smoke too much Pippin.
 
PIPPIN:	But, well see each other soon?
 
Merry looks across at Gandalf
 
PIPPIN:	Wont we?
 
Merry looks up at Pippin.
 
MERRY:	I dont know! I dont know whats going to happen. (as he backs away, upset)
 
PIPPIN:	Merry? 
 
GANDALF:	Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste.
 
PIPPIN:	Merry!
 
They gallop off. Merry runs up the steps to the top of a watchtower. 
 
ARAGORN:	Merry! (he follows him and they watch Shadowfax fading into the distance.)
 
MERRY:	Hes always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get him out. Now hes gone. (looks at Aragorn) Just like Frodo and Sam.
 
ARAGORN:	One thing Ive learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk.
 
MERRY:	Foolhardy maybe. Hes a Took! (laughs)

  Scene 9

 Scene is in a woodland showing a long train of elves riding slowly along a path. Zooms in on Arwen
.

ELROND:	Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea. The last journey of Arwen Undmiel. 
 
A child runs across the path on front of the elves. Arwen watches him as he runs into a  Scene where Aragorn stands looking out of the window. 
Aragorn turns and runs over to the boy, swinging him up in his hands, smiling at him and turning around with him. Arwen watches as the boy looks down into Aragorns face. Aragorn kisses him on the cheek and he laughs then he stops and looks directly at Arwen. 
The camera moves back and forth between them as Arwen notices the Evenstar around his neck. She closes her eyes and a tear falls from them. 

Cuts to Elrond
 
ELROND:	There is nothing for you here only death.
 
Cuts back to Arwen still with her eyes closed. She can now only see the forest with no additional scene.
 
FIGWIT:	Lady Arwen we cannot delay. (she turns her horse around and gallops off) My lady!
 
She rides off and the elves continue on their journey.

  Scene 10

 
Cuts to Arwen riding across the bridge at Rivendell. She rides up and runs towards her father dropping her cloak. As she runs up the steps
ARWEN:	Tell me what you have seen.
 
Elrond stands up and approaches her.
 
ELROND:	Arwen.
 
ARWEN:	You have the gift of foresight. What did you see?
 
ELROND:	I looked into your future and I saw death.
 
ARWEN:	But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son.
 
ELROND:	That future is almost gone.
 
ARWEN:	But it is not lost.
 
ELROND:	Nothing is certain.
 
ARWEN:	Some things are certain.
 
ARWEN:	If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time.
 
 Scene changes to inside where a cloaked figure is shown approaching the shards of Narsil.
 
ARWEN:	From the ashes of fire shall be woken, 
A light from the shadow shall spring, 
Renewed shall be blade that was broken, 
( Scene changes showing the breaking of the blade beneath Saurons foot and then back to the shards of Narsil) 
The crownless again shall be king.
 
The  Scene returns to the conversation between Elrond and Arwen.
 
ARWEN:	Reforge the sword ada.
 
The camera is on Arwen as Elrond walks away pans out from her showing her holding a book in a different scene. She sits down and drops the book out of her hands. She rubs her fingertips. Elrond picks up the book. He holds her hands.
 
ELROND:	Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you. 
 
He looks at her worried.
 
ARWEN:	This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
 
 Scene changes to show the reforging of Narsil into Anduril the Flame of the West.

 Scene 11

 	 
Gandalf and Pippin gallop across plains and through forest. They splash through a river.
 
GANDALF:	We have just passed into the realm of Gondor.
 
They gallop up a hill and look down at a great white city.
 
GANDALF:	Minas Tirith. City of Kings. 
 
They gallop through the city until they reach the topmost level. They stop in front of a huge white hall. As they walk towards the door they pass a dead white tree. Pippin spots it.
 
PIPPIN:	Its the tree! Gandalf, Gandalf.
 
GANDALF:	Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
 
He stops and turns to Pippin at the door.
 
GANDALF:	Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromirs father. To give him news of his beloved sons death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if you dont speak at all Peregrin Took. 
 
They walk through the massive hall approaching the throne where a man sits in a seat at the base of the steps to the throne. 
 
GANDALF:	Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor.
 
The camera cuts to show Denethor bent over a broken horn.
 
GANDALF:	I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel.
 
DENETHOR:	Perhaps you come to explain this. 
 
He shows the horn to them. 
 
DENETHOR:	Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead.
 
 Scene cuts to the death of Boromir as remembered by Pippin.
 
PIPPIN:	Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from many foes. (He approaches the throne and kneels down)
 
GANDALF:	Pippin.
 
PIPPIN:	I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt. 
 
DENETHOR:	This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not? So mighty as man as he was.
 
PIPPIN:	The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by many.
 
Denethor is visibly upset.
Gandalf walks forward hitting Pippin with his staff to move him out of the way.
 
GANDALF:	Get up!
 
GANDALF:	My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Gondors armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
 
DENETHOR:	You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship. 
 
GANDALF:	Authority is not given to you to deny the , steward.
 
Denethor jumps up angry.
 
DENETHOR:	The rule of Gondor is mine and no others!
 
Pippin looks between Gandalf and Denethor as they stare at each other angrily. Gandalf turns.
 
GANDALF:	Come!
 
They walk rapidly from the hall.

 Scene 12

 	 
GANDALF:	All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak! A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again.
 
They walk through the courtyard towards the tree.
 
PIPPIN:	Why are they still guarding it? 
 
GANDALF:	They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay. (The camera shows the city of Minas Tirith) 
The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent ( the camera moves around and pans in on the city of Minas Tirith) dearer than the names of their sons. (They walk along the parapet to the end) 
Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. (camera moves in on Gandalf and Pippin looking out over the city of Minas Tirith) 
The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.
Pippin moves away from Gandalf looking at the mountains of Mordor and the disturbances that go on there. 
 
PIPPIN:	Mordor.
 
GANDALF:	Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.
 
PIPPIN:	A storm is coming.
 
GANDALF:	This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Saurons making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin.
 
PIPPIN:	Well Minas Tirith very impressive. (looks at Gandalf enquiringly) So where are off to next?
 
GANDALF:	Oh, its too late for that Peregrin. Theres no leaving this city. (He looks towards Mordor) 
Help must come to us.

 Scene 13

The  Scene changes to Frodo and Sam wandering through a grey leafless forest, following Gollum.
.

SAM:	It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.
 
GOLLUM:	Were not in decent places.
 
The camera moves to Frodo.  He looks concerned.
 
SAM:	Mr Frodo?  What is it?
 
FRODO:	Its just a feeling.  I dont think Ill be coming back.
 
Sam walks over to him.
 
SAM: 	Yes you will.  Of course you will.  Thats just morbid thinking.  Were going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo.  Youll see.
 
He stands back to let Frodo lead off in front.  They arrive at the crossroads.  There is a statue of a King scrawled all over with red graffiti.
 
FRODO:	 I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor.
 
They walk around to the front of the statue as the camera moves up it.
 
FRODO:	Long ago, when there was a King.
 
The camera shows the head of the King replaced by a roughly worked, iron wrapped stone.  As Frodo and Sam move off they come across the Kings head on the ground with flowers weaved around its top like a crown.  The sun comes out and illuminates the Kings head.am turns around and sees it.  
 
SAM: 	Mr Frodo, look!  The King has got a crown again.  
 
He smiles at Frodo and the sun goes in.
 
GOLLUM: 	Come on, Hobbits!  Mustnt stop now.   This way!  
 
They continue to follow him.
 
 	 
 Scene 14

 	 
Gandalf stands looking out of a window in Gondor smoking his pipe.  Distant thunder can be heard.  The camera shows Pippin behind Gandalf.  Gandalf coughs.
 
PIPPIN: 	So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.  (He picks up a sword and pulls it out of its scabbard and replaces it again, putting it down.)  I mean, they dont actually expect me to do any fighting,   do they?  (looks at Gandalf uncertainly.)
 
GANDALF:	Youre in the service of the steward now.  Youll have to do as you are told Peregrin Took. (Gandalf coughs some more).  
 
The camera shows Pippin pouring a goblet of water.  (off camera)
 
GANDALF:	Ridiculous Hobbit!  Guard of the Citadel! 
 
Gandalf continues to cough.  The camera moves to show Mordor again then moves back to Gandalf who is still coughing.  Pippin hands him a goblet of water.
 
GANDALF: 	Thank you.  (he touches Pippin shoulder.  Pippin moves forward studying the sky.)
 
PIPPIN:	Theres no more stars!  Is it time?  (looks at Gandalf)
 
GANDALF:	Yes.
 
Pippin leans on the parapet.
 
PIPPIN:	 Its so quiet.  
 
Gandalf stands behind him.
 
GANDALF:	Its the deep breath before the plunge. 
 
PIPPIN:	I dont want to be in a battle.  But waiting on the edge of one I cant escape is even worse. (he looks at Gandalf)  Is there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?  
 
Gandalf leans down on the parapet next to him.
 
GANDALF: 	There never was much hope.  Just a fools hope.  (He smiles at Pippin and looks back to Mordor)  Our enemy is ready.  His full strengths gathered.   Not only orcs, but men as well (shows the Haradrim.)  Legions of Haradrim from the South, mercenaries from the coast (shows ships.)  All will answer Mordors call.  (shows ships again)  
 
CAPTAIN:	Come on!
 
Camera goes back to Gandalf and Pippin on the balcony.  
 
GANDALF:	This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.    Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.  (camera moves over to show Osgiliath.)  If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone. 
 
PIPPIN: 	But we have the white wizard.  Thats got to count for something.  (smiling at Gandalf).
 
Gandalf looks at him worried.  
 
PIPPIN: 	Gandalf?
 
Gandalf turns away looking at Mordor.
The camera shows a different  Scene with a Black cloaked figure.
 
GANDALF:	Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant. 
(shows an articulated gaunlet being put on by the black cloaked figure.)  
The one who will lead Mordors army in war.  (shows a black helmet being donned)  The one they say no living man can kill. (camera moves back to Gandalf) 
The Witch King of Angmar. Youve met him before.  (Pippin looks at Gandalf)  
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop. (Flashes back to the  Scene on Weathertop when Frodo is stabbed.)  
He is the lord of the Nazgl.  The greatest of the nine.
 
 
 Scene 15

 

 Scene changes to show Frodo, Sam and Gollum approaching a wall.  They peer over it to look at Minas Morgul.
 
GOLLUM: 	The Dead City!  Very nasty place full of enemies.
 
He jumps up over the wall and the Hobbits follow him.  They move across the front of the City.
 
GOLLUM: 	Quick, quick!  They will see, they will see!
 
Gollum and Sam begin to climb up the steps on front of the city.  Frodo looks at the Silent Watcher.
 
GOLLUM: 	Come away, come away.  Look we have found it.  The way into Mordor.
 
They look up the steep steps.  
 
GOLLUM:	The secret stair.  Climb.
 
Frodo hesitates and looks back at the city.  His gaze is drawn and he is forcibly drawn inexorably towards it.  
 
SAM:	No!  Mr Frodo
 
GOLLUM: 	Not that way!
 
They run after him.am grabs him to stop him.
 
GOLLUM: 	Whats it doing?
 
SAM:	No!
 
FRODO: 	Theyre calling me.
 
SAM: 	 No!
 
Frodo and Gollum struggle with Frodo pulling him back towards the stairs.  They fall over, there is a bright flash and a huge signal goes up from the tower of the city.
Camera moves to Gandalf and Pippin who see the signal rise up into the sky from their balcony.  Camera returns to Frodo and Sam as Frodo struggles up off the ground.  The ground shakes and they struggle to climb up the first stairs.
 

GOLLUM:	Hide, hide!  
 
Camera shows the people of Gondor watching the signal go up, in fear.  Moves up behind Gandalf and Pippin, who looks at Gandalf in alarm.  Gandalf puts his arm  around Pippins shoulder. 
The camera returns to Sam and Frodo.  Frodo clutches his shoulder in agony, sweating with pain.  As they peer over the edge of the stair, a fell beast alights on the top of the tower bearing The Witch King.  The Witch King screeches and they hold their ears in agony trying to stop the noise.  Frodo clutches his shoulder again.
 

FRODO:	I can feel his blade.  (he groans in agony.)  
 
The camera moves back to the fell beast which roars down at the opening doors to the citadel.  Out of the doors march Mordors armies of Orcs.  The camera moves back to Gandalf.
 
GANDALF:	We come to it at last.  (Pippin looks up at him)  The great battle of our time.  
 
The camera moves back to follow Mordors army of Orcs marching over the bridge.  Frodo and Sam watch as they pass just feet below them.  The fell beast takes off from the tower.  It swoops low over Sam and Frodos heads down to hover over the army.  
 
GOLLUM: 	Come away Hobbits.  We climb.  We must climb.  
 
The Hobbits climb the stair after Gollum with the huge army continuing to pass by below them.  The camera goes back to Gandalf.
 
GANDALF: 	The board is set, the pieces are moving.
 
 Scene 16

 	 
And then back to Sam, Frodo and Gollum.
 
GOLLUM:	Up, up, up the stairs we go.  And then its into the tunnel.
 
SAM: 	Hey,  whats in this tunnel?  (Sam grabs Gollum)  You listen to me!  You listen good and proper.  Anything happens to him, youll have me to answer to.   One sniff that somethings not right, one hair that stands up on the back of my neck, its over.  No more slinker, no more stinker.  (Frodo watches them)  Youre gone.  Got it?  Im watching you.  (Gollum watches slyly as Sam moves off.)
 
FRODO:	What was that about?  
 
SAM:	Nothing.  Just clearing something up. 
 
Gollum sneers after him. 

 Scene 17

 Scene moves to the streets of Minas Tirith.  Gandalf and Pippin are rushing through them.  
.

GANDALF:	Peregrin Took my lad, there is a task now to be done.  Another opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth.  (He leads Pippin to the base of a great watch tower.  Gandalf puts his hand on Pippins shoulder.)  You must not fail me.  
 
Pippin runs over to the cliff face and begins to climb up to the beacon.


 Scene 18

 	 
The  Scene changes to the river at Osgiliath. Soldiers are going about routine business; cooking on an open fire, sharpening blades etc.  The camera follows Faramir moving through the ruined buildings.  
 
FARAMIR:	Its been very quiet across the river.  
 
MADRIL:	The Orcs are lying low.  The garrison may have moved out.  Weve sent scouts to Cair Andros.  If the Orcs attack from the North, well have some warning.  
 
The  Scene changes to show Orcs silently rowing through the river.  The camera moves in on a particularly grotesque Orc.
 
GOTHMOG:	Quiet.   
 
 Scene changes back to the soldiers in the ruins.
 
SOLDIER:	We need 10 more.  
 
The camera pans across the river, showing the Orcs sneaking up on the men of Gondor.  Finally, a soldier spots them on the river.  
 
GOTHMOG:	Kill him.
 
An Orc fires an arrow at the soldier who falls down backwards amongst the rest.  Faramir and Madril  hear the fall and run towards the noise.  Faramir sees the dead soldier with the Orc arrow sticking out of him.
 
FARAMIR: 	Theyre not coming from the North!  To the river quick, quick!
 
DAMROD:	Go,  come on!
 
Camera moves across to the chief, grotesque Orc.
 
GOTHMOG:	 Faster!  (The Orcs row much faster and they arrive at Osgiliath just as the soldiers are there to meet them)  Draw swords.  (The Orcs begin to disembark from their boats, whilst the men wait behind the pillars.  They jump out and engage the Orcs.  Fighting ensues.)
 
SOLDIER:	Hold!  Hold them!  
 
The fighting is fierce, but the men are badly outnumbered.  More and more Orcs pour into Osgiliath.
 
 Scene 19

 	 
Meanwhile, back at the beacon in Minas Tirith, Pippin is just arriving at the top of the cliff and climbs onto the beacon itself.  
He climbs up the beacon and reaches up to try to reach a burning lamp.  Gandalf watches from below.  As Pippin pulls on the oil container to try to reach up, the rope breaks and oil pours down onto the dry straw.  Pippin reaches the lamp and drops it onto the beacon.  
He watches with satisfaction as it begins to burn, then suddenly he realises his danger and moves off the beacon quickly to avoid being set alight.  
The soldiers on guard suddenly notice that the beacon is alight.
 
SOLDIER: 	What?  
 
They move towards the fire in astonishment, watching it burn.
Gandalf smiles with satisfaction when he sees it.  He runs out over a parapet and looks out into the distance. 
 
GANDALF: 	 Amon Dn.
 
He watches as a beacon blazes forth on the distant mountains.  
 
SOLDIER:	The beacon!  The beacon of Amon Dn is lit.  
 
Gandalf laughs, pleased.  Denethor sees through a window and retreats looking very unhappy. 
 
GANDALF:  	Hope is kindled!  
 
The beacons are lit all across the mountains until finally one, that can be seen by Aragorn in Edoras, goes up in flames.

 Scene 20

 	 
Aragorn spots the beacon alight and runs into the Great Hall. He bursts through the door shouting.
 
ARAGORN:	The beacons of Minas Tirith!  The beacons are lit!  
 
Theoden and his generals turn to him.  
 
ARAGORN:	Gondor calls for aid.
 
There is a hesitation where the camera moves from person to person ending on Theoden.
 
THEODEN:	And Rohan will answer!  Muster the Rohirrim.  
(Eomer bows to him and leaves.  The bell rings out to gather the Rohirrim together.  Theoden leaves the hall hurriedly in full armour.)  
Assemble the army at Dunharrow,  as many men as can be found.  You have two days. 
(he speaks to Eomer as he walks at his side.  He grabs him by the shoulder to bring him face to face)  On the third, we ride for Gondor and war. (Eomer leaves) 
 
EOMER:	 Forward!  
 
SOLDIER: 	Very good sir.
 
THEODEN: 	 Gamling.  
 
GAMLING:	My lord!
 
Theoden walks over to him.
 
THEODEN:	Make haste across the Riddermark.ummon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.  
 
GAMLING:	I will.  (He leaves)
 
Theoden watches over the mustering of the men.
 Scene changes to Aragorn and Eowyn both tending to their own horses.
 

ARAGORN:	Do you ride with us?
 
EOWYN: 	Just to the encampment.  Its tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.  (Aragorn moves a blanket to reveal Eowyns sword.he snatches it down back over it and looks at him.)  
The men have found their captain.  They will follow you into battle.  Even to death.  You have given us hope.  (she smiles at him and Aragorn turns away uneasy.)
 
The  Scene changes to Merry holding his sword out in both hands.
 
MERRY:	Excuse me!  (Theoden turns to him)  I have a sword.  Please accept it!  (He kneels before Theoden King)  I offer you my service Theoden King.
 
Theoden moves over to him and raises him up.
 
THEODEN: 	And gladly, I accept it.  (He smiles at Merry)  You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.  (Merry smiles gleefully and turns away)
 
The  Scene changes to Legolas and Gimli once more on a horse together.
 
GIMLI: 	Horse men!  I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.  
 
LEGOLAS:	Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.  I fear war already marches on their own lands. 
 
The cameras show the soldiers getting ready to leave.  Merry is trying to get his small horse to move.  The camera moves to Theoden King who looks at the standard flying in the breeze.
 
THEODEN:	(thinks)o,  it is before the walls of Minas Tirith the doom of our time will be decided. 
 
Aragorn mounts his horse.
 
EOMER:	(shouting at the soldiers) Now is the hour, Riders of Rohan.  Oaths you have taken.  Now fulfil them all, to Lord and Land!  Hah!
 
The Riders gallop from Edoras.  Merry gallops along with them too.

 Scene 21

The  Scene returns to Osgiliath where the fighting is fierce.  But many men are being slaughtered. 

Faramir runs through an archway and Madril shouts his name.  He moves out of the way and archers kill the many Orcs that are running after him.
.

MADRIL:	We cant hold them.  The city is lost.
 
FARAMIR:	 Tell the men to break cover.  We ride for Minas Tirith.
 
Men continue to be slaughtered.uddenly a dreadful screech enters the scene.
 
DAMROD: 	Nazgl!
 
The Nazgul fly over the scene.
 
FARAMIR:	(shouting) Take cover!  Nazgul!  Fall back.  Fall back to Minas Tirith!  
 
As they fall back Madril is badly injured and falls to the floor.
 
FARAMIR: 	Fall back!  (the Nazgl harass the soldiers from above)  Retreat!  Retreat!  Run for your lives!  
 
As Madril lays injured Gothmog and orc stand looking down at him.  Gothmog takes a lance from the orc and kills Madril with it.  
 
GOTHMOG:	The age of men is over.  The time of the Orc has come.
 
The  Scene changes to show the soldiers trying to retreat over the plain to Minas Tirith.  The Nazgul harass them from the air.
 
SOLDIERS:	Keep going.  Its the Nazgul.  Take cover my lord.  
(The Nazgul swoop down and their beasts take soldiers in their claws, fly up with them and drop them to their deaths.) 
Its coming. 
 
The camera moves to Minas Tirith.  A lone white figure gallops out from the city towards the men.  
 
SOLDIERS IN MINAS TIRITH:	Its Mithrandir!  The White Rider!  
 
Gandalf gallops towards the stricken men as the Nazgul continue to harass and harry them.  Gandalf sends forth a bright light from his staff which drives off the Nazgul.  He joins the soldiers and they all gallop back to Minas Tirith together. 
The massive gates crank open.
 
SOLDIER: 	 Pull!
 
The doors open to admit the galloping soldiers with Gandalf.  
 
FARAMIR: 	Mithrandir!  (Gandalf turns to face him, Pippin is sitting in front of him on Shadowfax)  
They broke through our defences.  Theyve taken the bridge and the West bank.  Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.  
 
IROLAS: 	It is as the Lord Denethor predicted!  Long has he foreseen this doom!  
 
GANDALF:	 Foreseen and done nothing!  
 
Faramir sees Pippin and stares at him curiously.
 
GANDALF:	Faramir?  This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.
 
FARAMIR: 	No.  (he shakes his head)
 
PIPPIN:	Youve seen Frodo and Sam?  (He looks at him hopefully.  Faramir nods.)
 
GANDALF:	Where?  When?
 
FARAMIR: 	In Ithilien.  Not two days ago.  Gandalf, theyre taking the road to the Morgul vale.  
 
Gandalf looks horrified.
 
GANDALF:	And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.
 
Faramir nods.
 
PIPPIN: 	What does that mean? Whats wrong?  He looks at Gandalf.
 
GANDALF:	Faramir tell me everything.  Tell me all you know.  

 Scene 22

 	 
 Scene changes to Denethors angry face.
 
DENETHOR: 	 This is how you would serve your city?  You would risk its utter ruin?  
 
FARAMIR: 	I did what I judged to be right.
 
DENETHOR: 	What you judged to be right!  You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling!  It should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. Hidden.  Dark and deep in the vaults not to be used.  (his eyelids flicker unnaturally)  unless, at the uttermost end of need.
 
FARAMIR: 	I would not use the Ring.  Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her. 
 
DENETHOR:	Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old.   Boromir would have remembered his fathers need.   He would have brought me a kingly gift
 
FARAMIR: 	 Boromir would not have brought the Ring.   He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen.  
 
DENETHOR: 	You know nothing of this matter!
 
FARAMIR: 	He would have kept it for his own.  And when he returned you would not have known your son. 
 
DENETHOR: 	(shouting and running towards Faramir)  Boromir was loyal to me!   Not some wizards pupil.
 
Denethor stumbles backwards and falls against the Stewards chair.
 
FARAMIR: 	Father?  (He moves towards him)
 
Denethor looks up at him from the floor, smiling and grieving at the same time.  
 
DENETHOR:	My son!  (He can see Boromir behind Faramir who turns to face him and walking towards him smiling, fades away.  Denethor looks at Faramir full of grief for Boromir.  His face changes to one of hate.)  Leave me!  (Faramir turns from him to leave the hall.)
 
 Scene 23

 	 
The  Scene changes to Frodo, Sam and Gollum climbing the stairs of Cirith Ungol.  The city can be seen far below them.  Frodo stumbles and nearly falls.  
 
GOLLUM: 	Careful master!  Careful.   Very far to fall.  Very dangerous are the stairs.  
 
Gollum reaches the top and turns around to look at them climbing up.  
 
GOLLUM:	Come master.  
 
The Ring hangs from its chain around Frodos neck and Gollum sees it.  His eyes are mesmerised.  
 
GOLLUM:	Come to Smeagol.
 
He puts his hand out towards the Ring.am sees him.
 
SAM:	Mr Frodo!  (He draws his sword)  Get back you!  Dont touch him.  
 
Gollum reaches out and grabs Frodo by the wrist to pull him up.  
 
GOLLUM: 	Why does he hates poor Smeagol?  What has Smeagol ever done to him?  Master?  (He moves over to Frodo who is lying on his stomach on the floor, he pats his back)  Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden.  Fat one cannot know.  (Gollum moves closer to Frodo and whispers to him.)  He wants it.  He needs it.meagol sees it in his eye.  (Frodo looks at Gollum believing every word!)  Very soon he will ask you for it.  You will see.   The fat one will take it from you!  (Frodo turns to look at Sam climbing up and holds the Ring protectively.)  
 
 Scene 24

 	 
 Scene changes to Osgiliath.  The Witch King sits on his fell beast on top of one of the towers.  
 
WITCH KING: 	Send forth all legions.  Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.  
 
The camera moves to Gothmog and then back to the Witch King and his beast.
 
WITCH KING:	Slay them all!
 
GOTHMOG:	What of the wizard?
 
WITCH KING:	 I will break him. 
 
Camera moves to Gandalf in Minas Tirith, he moves over to the wall and looks over to Mordor.  
 
SOLDIER 1:	Where are Theodens riders?
 
SOLDIER 2:	Will Rohans army come?  Mithrandir?
 
GANDALF: 	Courage is the best defence that you have now.  

 Scene 25

 Scene changes to show Pippin sitting on a bench in his full Guard of the Citadel uniform.  His feet dangle as the bench is too high for him. 
.

PIPPIN: 	What were you thinking Peregrin Took?  What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of men?   
 
FARAMIR:	 (approaching through a door)  It was well done.  A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.  (Pippin jumps up and Faramir approaches him)  You are to join the tower guard.
 
PIPPIN:	I didnt think they would find any livery that would  fit me. 
 
FARAMIR: 	It once belonged to a young boy of the city.  A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.  
 
PIPPIN:	This was yours?  (smiling)
 
FARAMIR: 	Yes, it was mine.  My father had it made for me.  (He adjusts Pippins tunic)
 
PIPPIN:	Well, Im taller than you were then.  Though, Im not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.  (They laugh together)
 
FARAMIR: 	It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier.  (His smiles fades)  They were so alike he and my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong.  
 
PIPPIN: 	I think you have strength of a different kind.  And one day your father will see it.  (Faramir smiles.) 
 
 Scene 26

 	 
 Scene changes to show Pippin on his knees before the stewards chair.  Faramir stands back watching the proceedings.  
 
PIPPIN: 	Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living or dying, from (he hesitates over the words, the camera moves to Denethors smiling face)  from this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me.
 
DENETHOR: 	And I shall not forget it!  (He stands up and approaches Pippin)  nor fail to reward  that which is given.  (He offers Pippin his ring on his finger, Pippin closes his eyes and kisses it.  Denethor lifts Pippins face by the chin.)  Fealty with love.  (He walks over to a table)  Valour with honour.  Disloyalty with vengeance.  
(He turns and looks at Faramir and sits at the table, helping himself to food.)  
I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.  Defences that your brother long held intact.  
 
FARAMIR:	What would you have me do?
 
DENETHOR:	I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought.  Osgiliath must be retaken.  
 
FARAMIR: 	My lord Osgiliath is over run.  
 
DENETHOR:	Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lords will?  
 
Pippin looks at Denethor alarmed.
 
FARAMIR:	You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and Boromir had lived.  
 
DENETHOR: 	Yes, I wish that.  (He drinks from a goblet.)
 
Faramir stands quietly upset for a moment.
 
FARAMIR: 	Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.  (He bows deeply and turns to leave the hall.  Pippin watches him open mouthed.  Faramir turns back to his father.) 
If I should return, think better of me father. 
 
DENETHOR: 	That will depend on the manner of your return.  (Faramir walks from the room.)
 
 Scene 27

 	 
The  Scene changes to the Pass of Cirith Ungol.  Frodo and Gollum are asleep but Sam is lying trying to fight sleep off.  He finally loses the battle and drops off.  Gollum opens his eyes, instantly awake.  He sneaks over and opens the back pack.  He reaches in and takes out all the lembas wrappings.
 
GOLLUM:	 Ech! 
 
He recoils and then returns to what he was doing.  He crumbles the lembas over Sam as he sleeps and then throws the rest over the cliff.am wakes suddenly aware of Gollum.
 
SAM:	What are you up to?neaking off are we?  
 
GOLLUM:	Sneaking?neaking?  Fat Hobbit is always so polite.meagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say sneak!neak?  Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice!
 
SAM: 	Alright!  Alright!  You just startled me is all.  What were you doing?  (He looks over the cliff.)  
 
GOLLUM: 	Sneaking.
 
SAM:	Fine, have it your own way.  (He shakes Frodo by the shoulder)  Im sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be moving on.  (Frodo sits up.)
 
FRODO:	Its dark still.  
 
SAM: 	Its always dark here.  (He feels in the pack for the lembas, there is just a leaf wrapping left.)  Its gone!  (He searches some more)  The elven bread! (He looks at Frodo)
 
FRODO:	What?  Thats all we have left!  
 
Sam looks at Gollum.
 
SAM: 	He took it.  He must have. 
 
GOLLUM: 	Smeagol?  No, no, not poor Smeagol.meagol hates nasty elf bread.  (Frodo looks at him.)  
 
SAM:	Youre a lying rat!  What did you do with it?  
 
FRODO: 	(looking at Sam suspiciously)  He doesnt eat it. (He stands up)  He cant have taken it.  
 
GOLLUM: 	 Look, whats this?  (He brushes lembas crumbs off Sams shoulder)  Crumbs on his jacketses.  He took it!  (pointing)  He took it! (He jumps down in front of Frodo)  Ive seen him, hes always stuffing his face when masters not looking.
 
Frodo glares at Sam
 
SAM:	Thats a filthy lie!  ( he hits Gollum)  You stinking, two faced sneak!  (Sam grabs him by the throat and starts punching him.)
 
FRODO:	Sam!  
 
SAM: 	Call me(He continues to punch Gollum)
 
FRODO: 	Stop it!  (Sam punches him some more.  Frodo pulls him off)
 
SAM: 	 Ill kill him!
 
FRODO:	 Sam, no!  (He collapses down)
 
SAM: 	 Oh my!   Im sorry.  I didnt mean it to go so far.  I was just so, so angry!  Here just lets just rest a bit.
 
FRODO: 	 Im all right.  
 
SAM:	No.  No youre not all right, youre exhausted.  Its that Gollum.  Its this place.  Its that thing around your neck.  (Frodo looks at him suspiciously)  I could help a bit.  I could carry it for a while (camera focuses in on Frodos suspicious eyes), carry it for a while (showing Sams mouth in close up)  I could carry it I could carry it Share the load share the load share the load (a voice echoes in Frodos head.  He shoves hard at Sam.)
 
FRODO:	Get away!
 
SAM:	I dont want to keep it.  (Frodo stands up away from him eyeing him suspiciously)  I just want to help.  
 
Gollum appears from behind Frodo.
 
GOLLUM: 	See?ee?  He wants it for himself.  (Frodo looks at Sam, very suspicious now)
 
SAM:	Shut up you!  (He stands up)  Go away!  Get out of here!
 
FRODO:	No Sam!  Its you!  (Sam looks at him upset)  Im sorry Sam.  (Gollum watches from behind Frodo with a sly smile on his face)
 
SAM: 	(crying)  But hes a liar!  Hes poisoned you against me.  
 
FRODO: 	You cant help me any more.  
 
SAM: 	You dont mean that.  
 
FRODO: 	Go home.  
 
Sam backs off and sits down sobbing.  Frodo turns away and goes back to climbing the stairs.  Gollum follows him, sneering at Sam as he passes by him.
 	 
 Scene 28

 	 
The  Scene changes to Minas Tirith.  The soldiers of Minas Tirith are leaving to go and try to retake Osgiliath as Denethor has ordered.  Faramir leads his men.  The people are upset to see them go.  They throw flowers under the horses hooves.  
 
GANDALF: 	(shouts)  Faramir!  Faramir!  (He pushes through the crowd towards him)  Your fathers will has turned to madness.  Do not throw away your life so rashly.  
 
FARAMIR: 	Where does my allegiance lie if not here?  This is the city of the men of Nmenor.  I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory, her wisdom.
 
Gandalf watches as his horse walks away.
 
GANDALF:	Your father loves you Faramir.  (speaking to himself)  He will remember it before the end.  
 
Camera pans around to watch them leaving through the huge gates of Minas Tirith.  They form up in a long line to attack Osgiliath, walking forward steadily.  They break into a gallop as they approach the outpost.  The camera moves to show the Orcs in the ruins.  They see the approaching army.  The camera moves back and forth between the Orcs and the oncoming army.  
The  Scene changes showing Pippin in attendance waiting on Denethor who is still eating at the table.  He looks at Pippin.
 

DENETHOR:	Can you sing Master Hobbit?
 
PIPPIN:	(looking alarmed) well, yes.  At least well enough for my own people.  But we have no songs for great halls and evil times.
 
DENETHOR: 	And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?  Come, sing me a song.  (He continues to eat) 
 
PIPPIN:	Home is behind, The world ahead, (while he sings the  Scene changes to show the army bearing down on Osgiliath)  And there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night (Faramir screams out the charge, silently)  Until the stars are all alight.  (The Orc archers draw their bows in readiness.  Denethor eats his chicken)  Mist and shadow cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall (the Orc leader shouts the order to fire and the Orcs release their arrows whilst Denethor bites a tomato.  The juice/blood runs down his chin) fade.  (Pippins voice falters he looks at Denethor as he continues to bite his tomatoes, closes his eyes and cries.)
 
The  Scene changes to show Gandalf sitting alone staring into space.  
 Scene changes again to Osgiliath.  The Orcs are pushing huge siege towers over the bridge.
 

ORCS: 	March, march!   March, march march!  

 Scene 29

The  Scene changes again to show the mustering of the Rohirrim.  Aragorn and Theoden ride ahead of the army into camp.
.

SOLDIER:  	Make way for the King!  Make way, the King is here
 
SOLDIER: 	My lord!  (Theoden waves)
 
SOLDIER: 	 Hail to you sire!  
 
THEODEN	Grimbold, how many?
 
GRIMBOLD:	 I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord.  
 
SOLDIER:	We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.  
 
THEODEN: 	Where are the riders from Snowbourn?  
 
SOLDIER:	None have come my lord.  
 
Aragorn and Theoden look down on the armies from their high encampment.  
 
THEODEN:	Six thousand spears, less than half of what I had hoped for.
 
ARAGORN: 	Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.  
 
THEODEN:	(looks at him)  More will come (He goes to walk away)
 
ARAGORN:	Every hour lost hastens Gondors defeat.  (He looks at Theoden)  We have until dawn then we must ride.  
 
Theoden nods his head in agreement.  A neighing horse attracts his attention.  They both turn and notice how much difficulty the men have in calming down the horses that seem to be nervous of something.
Legolas and Gimli walk amongst them.  They meet Eomer who is saddling his horse.  
 

LEGOLAS: 	The horses are restless and the men are quiet.
 
EOMER:	They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.  
 
The camera moves to show a small cleft through the rocks.
 
GIMLI:	That road there where does that lead?  
 
LEGOLAS: 	 It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain.  
 
EOMER: 	None who venture there ever return.  That mountain is evil.  
 
He walks away.  The camera focuses on the cleft, a man struggles to calm down a frightened horse.  Aragorn stares at the pathway looking worried.  He sees the King of the Dead beckoning him.
 
GIMLI:	Aragorn!  (Aragorn jumps and turns around)  Lets find some food.  (When Aragorn looks again the King has gone.  He follows Gimli.)
 
The camera shows their encampment high on the mountain and the  Scene changes showing Eowyn talking to Merry
 
EOWYN: 	There.  A true esquire of Rohan.  
 
Merry feels his new helmet looking very pleased.  He draws his sword.
 
MERRY: 	Im ready!  (Eowyn jumps and laughs, holding her hands out to Merry.)orry.  It isnt all that dangerous.  Its not even sharp.  (He looks at the sword.)
 
EOWYN	Well thats no good.  You wont kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.  Come on.
 
Merry leaves the tent swinging the sword to and fro, practising.  
 
EOWYN: 	To the smithy, go!  (She encourages him, he runs off)
 
EOMER: 	(sitting around a campfire with Gamling) You should not encourage him.
 
EOWYN:	You should not doubt him.  
 
EOMER: 	I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.  (Gamling laughs.)
 
EOWYN:	Why should Merry be left behind?  He has as much cause to go to war as you.  Why can he not fight for those he loves?  (She becomes very serious and starts to walk away.)
 
EOMER: 	You know as little of war as that Hobbit.   When the fear takes him (he walks towards her) and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold.  Do you think he would stand and fight?  He would flee.  And he would be right to do so.  (He puts his hand on her shoulder)  War is the province of men Eowyn.  (He walks away, her left eye twitches.)
 
 Scene 30

 	 
The  Scene changes to show the guards looking down, watching a rider approaching along the steep path.
Switches to Aragorn dreaming.  He sees Arwen, the Pukel men and the entrance to the Dimholt.  
 

ARWEN (whispers)	I choose a mortal life.  (A tear falls from her eye)  I wish I could have seen him one last time.  
 
She fades and the evenstar pendent falls onto the ground and shatters.  Aragorn wakes suddenly drawing his sword.  A soldier stands in the doorway to his tent.
 
SOLDIER: 	Sir?  King Theoden awaits you my lord.  (He leaves.)
 
Aragorn follows him to Theodens tent.  Theoden looks at the hooded figure, then at Aragorn.
 
THEODEN:	I take my leave. 
 
The figure turns and removes the hood.  It is Elrond. 
 
ARAGORN:	 (bows) My lord Elrond
 
ELROND:	I come on behalf of one whom I love.  Arwen is dying.he will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.  The light of the evenstar is failing.  As Saurons power grows her strength wanes.  Arwens life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.  The Shadow is upon us Aragorn.  The end has come.
 
ARAGORN:	It will not be our end, but his.  
 
ELROND: 	(Looks at him in mockery)  You ride to war but not to victory.aurons armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know.  But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river. (The  Scene changes to many ships sailing up the river)  A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.  They will be in the city in two days.  Youre outnumbered Aragorn.  You need more men.
 
ARAGORN:	There are none.
 
ELROND: 	 There are those that dwell in the mountain.  
 
Aragorn sees a vision of the King of the Dead.  
 
ARAGORN:	Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight?  They believe in nothing.  They answer to no one
 
ELROND: 	They will answer to the King of Gondor.  
(He pulls out a sword from inside his cloak and holds it out in his hands to him)  Andril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil.  
 
Aragorn takes the blade from him.
 
ARAGORN: 	Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil.  
 
He draws it from the scabbard.  
 
ARAGORN: 	The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.  
 
ELROND: 	The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.  Put aside the Ranger.  Become who you were born to be nen i-Estel Edain. (I gave hope to the Dunedain)
 
ARAGORN:	 -chebin Estel anim.  (I have kept no hope for myself.)
 
He sheaths the sword.

 Scene 31

 	 
Aragorn is preparing his horse to leave.  Eowyn approaches him.
 
EOWYN: 	Why are you doing this?  The war lies to the East.  You cannot leave on the eve of battle.  You cannot abandon the men.  
 
ARAGORN:	Eowyn
 
EOWYN: 	We need you here.  
 
ARAGORN:	Why have you come?
 
EOWYN: 	Do you not know?
 
ARAGORN:	It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.  I cannot give you what you seek. 
 
She backs off upset.
 
ARAGORN:	 I have wished you joy since first I saw you. 
 
He touches her face and a tear springs into her eye.  He walks away.he stands alone crying.  As Aragorn walks through the camp
 
GIMLI: 	(sitting beside a tent) Just where do you think youre off to?
 
ARAGORN: 	Not this time.  This time you must stay Gimli. 
 
GIMLI:	 Hmmmm
 
LEGOLAS: 	 (walking up on the other side of Aragorn, leading his horse) Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?  
 
GIMLI: 	You might as well accept it.  Were going with you laddie.  Aragorn smiles.
 
The three of them ride from the camp along the Dimholt road.  Theoden and the soldiers see them leaving.
 
SOLDIER: 	Whats happening, where is he going?  I dont understand.  (They disappear into the cleft between the rocks)  Lord Aragorn!  Why does he leave on the eve of battle?  
 
GAMLING:	He leaves because there is no hope.
 
THEODEN: 	He leaves because he must.  
 
GAMLING: 	To few have come.  We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.  
 
Theoden shakes his head.
 
THEODEN: 	 No, we cannot.  But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.  (They nod in agreement.)

 Scene 32

 	 
Eowyn stands alone looking out into the distance, hugging herself. Theoden approaches her from behind.
 
THEODEN:	I have left instruction. (He walks past her also looking out into the distance.) The people are to follow your rule in my stead. (He turns around and looks at her.) Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the battle goes ill. 
 
EOWYN:	What other duty would you have me do my lord?
 
THEODEN:	Duty? (He shakes his head and moves towards her) no. (He takes her hands and looks at her) I would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed (He holds her head and puts his forehead on hers)  and no more despair
 
 Scene 33

The  Scene changes to show some riders moving through a barren canyon. 
 

GIMLI:	What kind of army would linger in such a place? 
 
LEGOLAS:	One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to the last King of Gondor (The camera shows Aragorn followed by Legolas and Gimli) to come to his aid, to fight. But when the time came, when Gondors need was dire, they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight, the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead. 
 
The camera follows them on their journey as Legolas speaks. Finally, they approach the entrance to the Paths of the Dead. They are walking, leading their horses by the reins.
 
GIMLI:	The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. 
 
They reach the doors. Legolas reads the inscription above the door.
 
LEGOLAS:	The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead (camera shows the symbols above the door) and the dead keep it. The way is shut. 
 
Something comes out of the door towards them at a rush. It spooks the horses, which pull on the reins and run away from them. 
 
ARAGORN:	Brego! (He shouts after his horse)
 
Gimli looks alarmed. 
 
ARAGORN:	I do not fear death! (He walks through the entrance, Gimli looks scared. Legolas follows after Aragorn.)
 
GIMLI:	Well this is a thing unheard of. An elf will go underground, where a dwarf dare not. Oh. Oh, Id never hear the end of it. (He runs after them.)
 
 Scene 34

 	 
The Rohirrim are breaking camp. Theoden emerges from his tent, followed by Eomer.
 
THEODEN:	We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. 
 
They mount their horses and are moving through the camp. Theoden sees Merry.
 
THEODEN:	Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc. 
 
MERRY:	All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind. 
 
THEODEN:	It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burdon. 
 
MERRY:	(looking upset) I want to fight!
 
THEODEN:	I will say no more. 
 
He turns and rides away, Merry watches him leave. He stands there looking forlorn. A rider approaches him at a gallop from behind and catches him up by the collar, swinging up into the saddle in front. He is amazed.
 
EOWYN:	Ride with me! 
 
MERRY:	My lady! (He smiles)
 
EOMER:	Form up, move out! Form up, move out! 
 
They begin to gallop.
 
THEODEN:	 Ride! Ride now to Gondor.
 
The camera moves back showing them riding through the valley in their thousands. 

 Scene changes to show marching Orcs with huge siege towers approaching Minas Tirith. Trolls bang on huge drums. 
 
 Scene 35

 	 
 Scene changes to show Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Aragorn leads them with a torch. It shows many human skulls on the floor. Aragorn moves on but Legolas remains looking at them.
 
GIMLI:	What is it? What do you see? 
 
LEGOLAS:	I see shapes of men and of horses.
 
GIMLI:	Where? (Looks around)
 
LEGOLAS:	Pale banners like shreds of cloud. (Aragorns eyes are wide open with concern, they continue to move on) Spears rise like winter thickets through a shroud of mist. The dead are following. They have been summoned. 
 
GIMLI:	(spins around to look behind) The dead? Summoned? I knew that! Huh. Huh. (He turns around slowly) Very good. Very good. (He realises he is alone) Legolas! (He shouts and runs after them.)
 
Ghostly hands writhe around Legolas and then Aragorn and finally Gimli. They are ethereal. Gimli tries to blow them away. He blows and wafts them away. Aragorn and Legolas turn looking at the hands. Aragorn glances down.
 
ARAGORN:	Do not look down. 
 
Gimli pauses and then looks down and sees human skulls on the floor. He steps forward gingerly and the skulls crunch beneath his feet. They emerge running from around a corner. Aragorn leads them forward into an open space which contains a large building. He turns looking around with his torch.
 
KING OF THE DEAD: 	Who enters my domain?
 
Aragorn turns and the King of the Dead appears before some steps in front of him. 
 
ARAGORN:	One who will have your allegiance. 
 
KING OF THE DEAD: 	The dead do not suffer the living to pass. 
 
ARAGORN:	You will suffer me! 
 
The King of the Dead laughs menacingly. As he does a whole Kingdom of buildings appear around them. Soldiers emerge from them. A deadly army surrounds them chanting.
 
KING OF THE DEAD: 	The way is shut! It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep it. (The Ghostly army closes around them) The way is shut! Now you must die! 
 
Legolas fires an arrow which passes straight through the King and clatters to the ground
 
ARAGORN:	(Walking towards him.) I summon you to fulfil your oath! 
 
KING OF THE DEAD: 	None but the King of Gondor may command me! 
 
He approaches Aragorn to attack him. Aragorn retaliates and blocks his sword with Anduril. 
 
KING OF THE DEAD: 	That blade was broken!
 
ARAGORN:	It has been remade. (He catches the King by the throat and pushes him back. The ghostly army stand looking at him.) Fight for us and regain your honour. What say you? (He looks at the dead army, walking through them.) What say you?
 
GIMLI:	Ach! You waste your time Aragorn. They had no honour in life and they have none now in death. 
 
ARAGORN:	I am Isildurs heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled. (He brandishes his sword at them) What say you? 
 
The King laughs again and the army begin to disappear.
 
ARAGORN:	You have my word! Fight and I will release you from this living death! (They disappear) What say you? 
 
GIMLI:	Stand you traitors! 
 
The Dead Army is gone. There is a cracking sound and the walls of the building in front of them begins to collapse. Hundreds of human skulls fall down towards them. 
 
ARAGORN:	Out! 
 
They climb up the thousands of skulls trying to climb over them. They begin to slide down with them. They manage to move across towards the exit as the skulls continue to fall.
 
ARAGORN:	Legolas! Run! 
 
They manage to leave the place running out of the cave as the skulls continue to rain down behind them. They emerge into the sunlight. Aragorn looks down from the high place to see ships on the river and a burning town. It looks like he thinks he is too late. He sinks down on his knees in despair, tears in his eyes. Legolas approaches him and puts his hand on his shoulder. Aragorn bows his head. Legolas and Gimli also look upset. 

There is a sound behind and Aragorn looks around to see the King of the Dead come out of the rocks and approach him.
 
KING OF THE DEAD: 	We fight! 

 Scene 36

 	 
The  Scene changes to the Orcs attacking Minas Tirith. They are approaching the walls with their siege engines.
 
SOLDIER:	Open the gate, quick! 
 
The gate opens and a lone horse walks through, dragging someone along the floor with their foot caught in its stirrup. We see it is Faramir. 

The Orcs are cranking back their catapults. Gothmog patrols the troops on his warg. 

The  Scene moves back to inside Minas Tirith. Faramir is being born on a stretcher.
 
IROLAS:	Quick! Hurry! 
 
Then it moves back again to the Gothmog trying to dismount from his warg. He stumbles, an orc tries to help him he pushes him away and limps of his own accord.

Back again to inside Minas Tirith. Irolas hurries through the forecourt and Denethor emerges from the building with his attendants following him.
 
DENETHOR:	Faramir! Say not that he has fallen. 
 
IROLAS:	They were outnumbered! None survived. 
 
Pippin looks upset. 

 Scene changes again back to the Orcs.
 
GOTHMOG:	Fear. The city is rank with it! Ha ha ha ha. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners! 
 
ORC:	Catapults! (They release the catapults, firing the heads of fallen Gondorians over the walls into the city) ha ha ha. (The Gondorian soldiers inside recoil in horror.)
 
The  Scene changes back to Denethor.
 
DENETHOR:	My sons are spent! (He staggers away from Faramir) My line has ended! (Pippin runs to Faramir and touches his face.)
 
PIPPIN:	Hes alive! 
 
DENETHOR:	(walking away looking back frequently) The house of Stewards has failed. 
 
PIPPIN:	He needs medicine my lord! 
 
DENETHOR:	My line has ended! 
 
PIPPIN:	My lord!
 
Denethor looks over the wall at the massive Orc army and his lip trembles. 

A Troll puts a massive boulder into a catapult.
 
DENETHOR:	Rohan has deserted us! 
 
The catapults let loose and the city begins to crumble. Chaos ensues with people trying to run away from the falling rubble. 
 
DENETHOR:	Theodens betrayed me! ABANDON YOUR POSTS! (Irolas looks stunned) FLEE! FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES! (The soldiers look confused and begin to leave their posts. Denethor turns around and a white stick hits him in the face. Gandalf hits Denethor across the stomach with his staff and then hits him down to the floor across his back.)
 
GANDALF:	Prepare for battle. Hurry men! To the wall! Defend the wall! Over here! Return to your posts.
 
The soldiers return to their posts. Gandalf rides Shadowfax up to the wall and looks out. 
 
GANDALF:	Send these foul beasts into the Abyss. 
 
They release their catapults into the Orcs. 
 
GOTHMOG:	Stay where you are! 
 
The camera shows both sets of catapults releasing blocks of masonry and boulders at each other. 
 
SOLDIER:	We need more rubble!
 
SOLDIER:	Watch out! (A boulder ploughs into the soldiers scattering them off the wall.)
 
SOLDIER:	Down to the lower levels quick! 
 
Soldiers and Pippin are running down to the lower levels.
 
SOLDIER:	Double up men! 
 
Boulders continue to fly back and forth between the two armies. A huge piece of masonry flies towards Gothmog. He moves out of the way at the last moment so that it doesnt squash him. A troll blinks at him, he spits on the masonry. 

The Ringwraiths fly towards Minas Tirith. They swoop down over the city attacking the soldiers. The Witch King knocks some soldiers off a bridge. The soldiers shelter inside away from him. Pippin is running he pulls off his helmet and holds his head screaming as the Ringwraiths screech. The Ringwraiths swoop down on the soldiers, picking them up and dropping them back down to kill them. 

Gandalf continues on the wall to encourage the soldiers.
 
GANDALF:	Hold them back, do not give in to fear. Stand to your posts. Fight! 
 
A catapult releases and the masonry smashes into the top of a siege engine, scattering orcs. The Ringwraiths continue to harass the soldiers from above. They knock off catapults and pick up many soldiers to drop them down again. 

Masonry falls all about the city. Pippin panics and is knocked over by the bigger people. 

Archers release their arrows towards the siege engines from the walls.
 
GANDALF:	Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls, kill the trolls!
 
The archers adjust their aim downwards and continue to fire. 
 
GANDALF:	Bring them down! 
 
One of the siege engines reaches the wall. A door falls down onto the top of the battlements and many orcs emerge fighting. Archers continue to defend and shoot the orcs. 

Some orcs try an assault on the gate. They run towards it with a battering ram. Many are slaughtered by arrows. The battering ram has no effect on the gate.

Back on the wall Gandalf still encourages the men.
 
GANDALF:	Fight them back! (He turns around and sees Pippin looking confused) Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel.
 
PIPPIN:	They called us out to fight. (He looks bemused. Another siege engine arrives at the wall, the gate opens and orcs emerge fighting. Some run towards Pippin who looks terrified but he doesnt react. Gandalf jumps and places himself in front of Pippin. He fights off the orcs.)
 
GANDALF:	This is no place for a Hobbit! 
 
He fights more orcs and kills them. As one approaches Gandalf from behind Pippin finally reacts. He draws his weapon and stabs the orc, killing him dead. He looks at his blood smeared sword in shock. 
 
GANDALF:	Guard of the Citadel indeed! (He smiles at Pippin. Pippin looks at him his eyes smouldering.) Now back up the hill quickly. Quick! 
 
Pippin turns away and runs up the steps with his sword in his hand. 

Back at the gates the orc bodies continue to pile up as they try to break down the gates with a battering ram. Gothmog walks up to them.
 
GOTHMOG:	What are you doing you useless scum? 
 
ORC:	The door wont give. Its too strong. 
 
Archers continue to kill the orcs who are piling up in heaps. 
 
GOTHMOG:	Get back there and smash it down!
 
ORC:	But nothing can breach it! 
 
A pause.
 
GOTHMOG:	Grond will breach it! (He turns and gives out the order) Bring out the wolfs head.
 
The  Scene changes to show some animals struggling to pull a huge piece of equipment. Trolls also struggle to push it from behind. 
 
ORCS:	(chanting) Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond!
 
Gandalf looks on in concern from the battlements. 
 
ORCS:	Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond! 
 
They continue to chant. The camera focuses on a huge wolfs head battering ram, with a fire lit in its mouth. It hangs on chains from a huge scaffolding which the orcs and animals are striving hard to push forward.

cene 37

Ships are sailing up the river. You can see the mercenaries on them. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli await the ships on the shore. 
 

ARAGORN:	You may go no further. 
 
The ships boson stands up in response.
 
ARAGORN:	You will not enter Gondor
 
BOSON:	Who are you to deny us passage? 
 
ARAGORN:	Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosons ear. 
 
GIMLI:	Mind your aim.
 
Legolas fits an arrow to his bow and takes aim. Just as he releases the arrow Gimli deliberately knocks the bottom of the bow sending Legolas aim off. The arrow kills a mercenary standing next to the boson. Legolas glares at Gimli, Aragorn looks across at Legolas.
 
GIMLI:	Oh! (He puts his hand to his mouth) Thats it, right, we warned you! Prepare to be boarded! 
 
The mercenaries laugh.
 
MERCENARY:	Boarded, by you and whose army? 
 
ARAGORN:	This army. 
 
The King of the Dead and his army emerge through Aragorn and attack the ships.

 Scene 38

 	 
Frodo and Gollum are climbing up the stairs of Cirith Ungol. They arrive at a cave entrance. Gollum points.
 
GOLLUM:	In there. 
 
FRODO:	(Looking uncertain) What is this place? 
 
GOLLUM:	Master must go inside the tunnel. 
 
FRODO:	Now that Im here I dont think I want to. (He backs off)
 
GOLLUM:	Its the only way. Go in or go back. 
 
FRODO:	I cant go back. (He walks into the tunnel entrance. Gollum watches him and then follows him.) 
 
FRODO:	Whats that smell.
 
GOLLUM:	Orcses filth. Orcses come in here sometimes. 
 
They walk further into the tunnel. It is pitch black. 
 
GOLLUM:	Hurry! This way.
 
Frodo walks on alone.
 
FRODO:	Smeagol? (He calls Gollum. Gollums voice sounds distant. ) 
 
GOLLUM:	Over here. 
 
Frodo stumbles towards the voice. He falls against the wall and gets spider web stuck to his hands. 
 
FRODO:	Ah aah! Its sticky, what is it? 
 
GOLLUM:	(From the distance) Youll see. Oh yes, you will see.
 
Frodo moves slowly forward.
 
FRODO:	Smeagol? (shouts) SMEAGOL! SMEAGOL! 
 
Frodo is alone. Tears start to his eyes. 
 
FRODO:	Sam. (He walks forward onto some bones. He looks terrified and looks around him to see various animals hanging up in webs. He begins to panic and starts to run through the tunnels.) 
 
Meanwhile Sam is climbing back down the stairs. He is crying. He slips and falls down the remainder of the stairs to the bottom
 
SAM:	Ow! (He groans and tries to sit up. He sees the remains of the lembas bread and their leaf wrappings sitting on a rock beside him. He picks one up, thinks for a minute and then crushes it in anger. He turns and looks back up the stairs.) 
 
Back in the tunnel Frodo is still running in fear. He falls and gets tangled in webs on the floor. He fights to stand up. He staggers back again. A voice sounds in his head.
 
GALADRIEL VOICEOVER:	And you Frodo Baggins, I give you the light of Erendil, our most beloved star. (He fumbles in his pocket and pulls out the Phial of Galadriel and looks at it.) May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out. 
 
He closes his eyes.
 
FRODO:	Aiya Erendil Elenion Ancalim (Hail Erendil brightest of the Stars!)
 
He thrusts the phial forward and it blazes forth with a bright light he looks at it surprised. Frodo senses a movement behind him and turns his head slowly around to look. He leaps up and Shelob a huge spider advances on him. He holds the light up to her, which she doesnt like and she stands back from him. Frodo falls over backwards as he tries to get away. She advances on him but he stands up and thrusts the light at her, making her back off. He falls over again and she thrust her stinger at him. He slashes at it with sting, jumps up and runs off. Shelob chases him. He manages to escape from her by falling through a hole too small for her to fit through. He drops the light. 

Frodo continues to run away through the tunnel but he gets stuck in a web. He is suspended in the web powerless.
 
GOLLUM:	Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? (Gollum appears in front of him to gloat over him) Caught in a web. Soon youll be eaten. 
 
Frodo gets angry and begins to slash at the web with Sting. Shelob comes up behind him, but Frodo is beginning to escape from the web. Gollum sees this and looks worried. He turns and runs away. Frodo advances through the web with Shelob behind him. Sting gets caught in the web, so Frodo lets go of it and runs after Gollum. He escapes through a narrow entrance and is struggling to release himself from the entangling webs around him. Immediately Gollum jumps on him and grabs him by the ears.
 
GOLLUM:	Got away did it precious? Not this time. Not this time. (He tries to grab the Ring.)
 
FRODO:	NO! (Gollum throws him against the rock face. Frodo runs back to attack him and pushes him down on the floor. He punches him.)
 
SMEAGOL:	It wasnt us. It wasnt us. (Frodo has him by the throat) Smeagol wouldnt hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it. 
 
Frodo lets him go and falls back. He looks at Gollum who is also lying down and gasping. He gets up.
 
FRODO:	I have to destroy it Smeagol. (Gollum looks at him.) I have to destroy it for both our sakes. 
 
He turns away and Gollums face changes to a nasty grimace. 
 
GOLLUM:	NO! (He launches himself at Frodo from behind. Who falls to the ground and pushes him straight over the top of his head. Gollum falls down to the bottom of the cliff.) Aaaaaaaaa.
 
Frodo gets up and starts to stagger along the path. He staggers against a rock.
 
FRODO:	Im so sorry Sam. (He falls to his knees.) Im so sorry. 
 
He falls to the ground, which is covered in grass in broad daylight. He lifts his head to look around him and looks up to see Galadriel standing in front of him. She walks towards him with her arms open to him.
 
GALADRIEL:	This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way, no one will. 
 
She bends down close to him and offers him her hand. He looks at it and her and then with a determined face he grabs her hand. She smiles at him and pulls him upright.
Frodo is on his feet back on the dark pass. He breathes heavily, a new look of determination on his face. He starts to walk along the path. 
 
 Scene 39

 	 
The Rohirrim are stopped beside a lake. Eomer gallops up.
 
EOMER:	The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower levels in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance. 
 
THEODEN:	Time is against us. Make ready!
 
The  Scene changes to show Eowyn.
 
EOWYN:	Take heart Merry. (Merry, who is eating something, looks at her.) It will soon be over
 
MERRY:	My lady. You are fair and brave and have much to live for (She looks at him.) and many who love you. I know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deedsbut Im not. Im a Hobbit. And I know I cant save Middle Earth. I just want to help my friends; Frodo, Sam, Pippin. More than anything I wish I could see them again. (He smiles up at her.)
 
EOMER:	Prepare to move out! 
 
THEODEN:	Make haste. We ride through the night. 
 
A soldier blows a horn. Merry and Eowyn exchange looks. Merry puts down his sandwich and puts on his helmet. He stands up and looks at her. She puts on her helmet too.
 
EOWYN:	To battle
 
MERRY:	To battle

 Scene 40

 	 
Back at Minas Tirith it is dark. Catapults fire balls of flame over the walls. 

The trolls all pull on a rope each which suspends Grond on its scaffolding. They pull the battering ram back as the Orcs continue to chant. It is released and crashes hard into the gate which shudders with the impact. 
 
GANDALF:	Back to the gate! Hurry!
 
Archers and Gandalf rush to defend the gate. Grond is released a second time. The gate shudders. 

 Scene 41

 
Pippin looks from the high parapet over the flaming city. He turns back to see Theoden leading a procession holding a flaming brand. Faramir is being borne on a stretcher. 
 

DENETHOR:	 I am steward of the house of Anrion. Thus have I walked, and thus now I will sleep. 
 
Pippin runs towards them. He watches the procession pass him in astonishment. 
 
DENETHOR:	Gondor is lost. There is no hope for men. (a single white bloom on the dead tree is shown as they pass by. The camera passes over Minas Tirith showing the full  Scene from the flaming first circle up to where the procession moves along the quiet street to the Tombs of the Kings.) Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must. 
 
They pass on to the Tombs bearing Faramir with them. Pippin follows on a little behind watching where they go. Denethor opens the doors to the Tomb and walks in with the procession following him.
 
DENETHOR:	No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn like the heathen Kings of old. (He turns to the followers) Bring wood and oil. 

 Scene 42

 	 
Back at the gate Grond continues to hammer the gate.
 
GANDALF:	Steady! Steady! 
 
With a mighty crash the battering ram breaks through the centre of the gate. 
 
GANDALF:	You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate you will stand your ground.
 
Grond hits the gate once more. It bursts open and in charge Cave Trolls brandishing huge maces. Gandalf looks alarmed. 
 
GANDALF:	Volley! (He shouts to the archers.) Fire! 
 
They fire into the Trolls and the infantry lower their spears in defence. Orcs advance on them and there is fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The Trolls follow up swinging their maces from side to side sweeping aside all opposition. 
 
 Scene 43

 	 
Frodo is moving along the pathway. He spots the lookout tower at the top of the pass and pauses to look at it. He runs to look at it from behind a rock. Above him two spider legs emerge from a gap in the rock. Frodo moves forward slowly as the spider sneaks up on him from above and behind. She moves directly above him as Frodo looks at the Tower. He hears a slight noise behind him and spins around to look. He sees nothing. He is looking around, Shelob comes down behind him with her sting. He turns and suddenly she stings him in the chest. He foams at the mouth and collapses. Immediately, she winds him up in a binding web. She covers him from top to bottom. 

An arm appears on the screen holding Sting. The camera turns to show Sam holding up the Phial of Galadriel. 
 
SAM:	Let him go, you filth! Let him go! 
 
Shelob drops Frodo on the ground.
 
SAM:	You will not touch him again! (He advances on Shelob) Come on then, finish it! 
 
He runs towards her and slashes at her face. Shelob strikes back at him. Sam slashes at her leg. She throws him backwards and he drops the light. Shelob kicks the light away advancing on Sam. She harries him down to the floor and pushes him up the wall. He holds on to her pincers as they try to grasp him. He gets above her and kicks her in the face, she falls back a little. Sam tries to escape up the rocks. She grabs him, he falls down over her back and onto the ground. He moves around and Shelob gathers herself for a final pounce on him from above. Sam manages to thrust Sting into her eyes and she falls back in pain. Sam thrusts Sting at her again. She grabs it with her pincers and wrestles for it with Sam. Eventually Sting flies out of his hand as he turns to run and get it Shelob knocks him forward onto the ground. He is just about to grab the sword when Shelob stands on it and stops him. He turns around. She is right above him and thrusts with her sting at him. He rolls over as she tries to sting him over and over again. Finally he is able to pick up Sting and thrusts upwards into her body. She writhes in pain. Sam manages to get the light and thrusts it at her.
 
SAM:	Back! 
 
Shelob retreats backwards through a hole and disappears.
 
SAM:	Mr Frodo! 
 
He runs to Frodo, putting down Sting he pulls the webs away from his face. Frodo looks dead. Sam cries.
 
SAM:	Oh no! Frodo, Mr Frodo. (He shakes him. He picks him up and cradles him in his arms, crying.) Wake up. Dont leave me here alone. Dont go where I cant follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead. (He cuddles him to him crying. Suddenly Sting takes on a blue tinge and Sam sees it. Noise from the pass attracts his attention. Orcs are there.) 
 
SHAGRAT:	You get back you scum! 
 
Sam looks around hurriedly.

Shagrat comes down from the pass with other Orcs following him.
 
SHAGRAT:	Whats this? 
 
He approaches Frodo lying on the ground. Looks like old Shelobs been having a bit of fun. (Sam watches from a cave entrance.)
 
ORC:	Killed another one has she? 
 
SHAGRAT:	No. (He pokes Frodo with his whip.) This fellow aint dead.
 
SAM:	(whispers) Not dead. 
 
SHAGRAT:	She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish aaa then she has her way with them. Thats how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the Tower! (They pick Frodo up and take him with them up the pass.)
 
SAM:	Samwise you fool.
 
ORC:	This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.
 
SHAGRAT:	Then hell wish hed never been born.
 
He looks around and then follows them up the steps. 

Sam gets up to follow them.
 
 Scene 44

 	 
Pippin watches from behind a pillar. The soldiers lay Faramir on a bed of sticks and pile wood up all around him. Pippin moves closer.
 
DENETHOR:	The house of his spirit crumbles. (He holds Faramirs head.) He is burning. Already burning. 
 
PIPPIN:	Hes not dead. HES NOT DEAD (He shouts and starts pulling the wood away.) NO! NO! Hes not dead. (Denethor drags Pippin away along the corridor.)
 
DENETHOR:	Farewell Peregrin son of Paladin.
 
PIPPIN:	NO! NO! 
 
DENETHOR:	I release you from my service. (He throws him out of the door.) Go now and die and what way seems best to you. 
 
He closes the door and Pippin looks desperate. From inside; 
 
DENETHOR	Pour on oil! 
 
 Scene changes to soldiers in the city. 
 
SOLDIER:	Come on soldier, move it. 
 
SOLDIER:	Hurry along there, hurry along.
 
Pippin struggles against them as he tries to find Gandalf.
 
PIPPIN:	Gandalf! (The soldiers run past him.) Wheres Gandalf? (They ignore him. He shouts.) GANDALF! 

 Scene 45

 Fireballs continue to rain down on the city.
 

 GANDALF:	  Retreat! The city is breached. Fall back to the second level. Get the women and children out. Get them out. Retreat. 
 
SOLDIERS ON GATE:	Come on, come on! (They hurry people through the gate before closing it.)
 
 Scene changes to the Orcs outside the city. 
 
GOTHMOG:	Move into the city. Kill all in your path. 
 
The Orcs move into the city killing everyone they come across.
 
SOLDIER:	Take them down! 
 
Women scream as they try to get away. Men are butchered.
 
GANDALF:	Fight! Fight to the last man. Fight for your lives. 
 
PIPPIN:	Gandalf! (He manages to attract Gandalfs attention.) Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind. Hes burning Faramir alive! (Gandalf grabs Pippin by the arm.)
 
GANDALF:	Up! Quickly! 
 
He swings him up onto Shadowfax. They gallop towards the upper levels. Suddenly as they come out of a tunnel The Witch King alights on his fell beast in front of them.
 
GANDALF:	(He holds his staff across the front of him.) Go back to the abyss! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master! 
 
WITCH KING:	Do you not know death when you see it, old man? (Pippin screams, hiding behind Gandalf.) This is my hour! (He draws his sword which bursts into flames. Gandalfs staff bursts asunder in his grasp throwing him and Pippin from Shadowfaxs back.) 
 
PIPPIN:	 Gandalf! 
 
The fell beast roars in Gandalfs face. Pippin draws his sword and runs towards it. 
 
PIPPIN:	AAAAhhh! (The fell beast roars at him, he stops in fear. Shadowfax prances around and Gandalf looks up from the floor.) 
 
WITCH KING:	You have failed! The world of men will fall. (He lifts his sword but a horn sounds in the distance. He turns to it and listens, looks back at Gandalf and then flies off on his beast.) 
 
 Scene 46

 	 
 Scene changes to the battlefield. Gothmog also hears the horn. The Rohirrim line up against the skyline. The horsemen advance. Theoden looks down on the battlefield. Eowyn puts her arm around Merrys shoulder.
 
EOWYN:	Courage Merry. Courage for our friends. 
 
GOTHMOG:	Form ranks you maggots. Form ranks. Pikes in front, archers behind. (The Orcs prepare to meet them.)
 
Theoden turns to him men.
 
THEODEN:	Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank
 
EOMER:	Flank ready!
 
THEODEN:	Gamling, follow the Kings banner down the centre. Grimbold! Take your company right after you pass the wall. Forth and fear no darkness! (He addresses the men.) Arise! Arise riders of Theoden. Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered, a sword day, a red day ere the sun rises!!
 
The soldiers lower their spears in readiness, the Orcs lower their pikes in defence.
 
EOWYN:	Whatever happens, stay with me. Ill look after you. (Merry smiles and looks around at all the soldiers.) 
 
Theoden rides across the front of the men, running his sword along all their spears.
 
THEODEN:	Ride now, ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the worlds ending! DEATH!
 
ARMY:	DEATH! 
 
THEODEN:	DEATH! 
 
ARMY:	DEATH! 
 
THEODEN:	DEATH! 
 
THEODEN:	DEATH! 
 
EOWYN/MERRY:	DEATH! 
 
THEODEN:	Forth Eorlingas! 
 
The horns are sounded. Theoden and the army begin to walk forward. They break into a gallop as they approach the enemy.

Orc archers prepare themselves. 
 
GOTHMOG:	FIRE! (The orc archers release their arrows and some riders fall but they continue to gallop on.)
 
MERRY:	DEEEEAAATH!
 
THEODEN:	CHAAAAARGE! 
 
GOTHMOG:	Fire at will! (The archers fire, Gothmogs face changes as they come closer, he becomes scared. Orcs begin to get scared and run off. The Rohirrim smash into the Orcs slaughtering them right, left and centre.)

 Scene 47

 	 
Meanwhile, back in the Tombs of the Kings Denethor empties a jug of oil over his head. Faramir is also covered in oil.
 
DENETHOR:	Set a fire in our flesh! 
 
He stands above Faramir with his arms extended sideways. The soldiers advance on the pyre with torches in their hands. Suddenly the door bursts open Gandalf is there. Denethor turns to look at him.
 
GANDALF:	Stay this madness! 
 
Denethor grabs a torch and stands with it in his hand.
 
DENETHOR:	You may triumph in the field of battle for a day, but against the power that has risen in the east, there is no victory! 
 
He drops the torch on the timbers, which catch alight instantly. Gandalf grabs a spear off a guard at the door and gallops up to the pyre. He knocks Denethor off the pyre to the floor. Pippin jumps from the back of Shadowfax onto the top of the pyre, he struggles but manages to roll Faramir off the top of the pyre onto the floor. He uses his hands to douse any flames that have caught on Faramir.
Denethor jumps up!
 

DENETHOR:	NOOOOOO, you will not take my son from me! (He struggles with Pippin.)
 
PIPPIN:	NO! Aaahhh
 
Gandalf rides up on Shadowfax who kicks Denethor away back onto the pyre. 
 
DENETHOR:	Faramir! 
 
Faramir opens his eyes and looks at his father. 
 
DENETHOR:	Aaaaaahhhh! 
 
He catches on fire, he jumps off the pyre and runs up the corridor, he runs all the way along the forecourt and falls from the end of the parapet a ball of flames. 
 
GANDALF:	So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion. 

 Scene 48

 Scene changes to show the battlefield. Eomer and Theoden are fighting from horseback. So are Eowyn and Merry and the rest of the Rohirrim. They are beating the Orcs.
 
EOMER:	Drive them to the river. 
 
They chase the Orcs towards the river.
 
THEODEN:	Make safe the city.
 
Something attracts Theodens attention. He stares with his mouth dropped open. We see a line of Mmakil moving towards the Rohirrim. One of the Haradrim who steers a Mmakil sounds a horn. They begin to charge towards the Rohirrim
 
THEODEN:	Re-form the line! Re-form the line!
 
The Rohirrim re-form up into their lines.
 
THEODEN:	Sound the charge. Take them head-on. Chaaarge! 
 
They charge towards the Haradrim. The Mmakil sway their tusks from side to side ploughing into the Haradrim and throwing them up into the air. They trample all that they can.
  
  The Rohirrim bravely move in close, riding between the deadly feet. They fire arrows and slash at the Mmakil. Haradrim fire arrows from the backs of the Mmakil. The battle is fierce. Many Rohirrim are killed. A particularly nasty looking Haradrim steers his Mmakil and looks like he is enjoying it. We see the Rohirrim attacking the Mmakil from underneath with many arrows. 
 
ROHIRRIM: 	Cut him down! 
 
Eomer spots the Haradrim, hoists up his spear and throws it at him. It kills him and he falls, his controls pull on the Mmakils ear,which makes it turn and crash into another one next to it. They both fall down dead, defeated.
Eowyn and Merry weave between the Mmakils legs. 
 

EOWYN: 	Take the reins, pull him left. (She snatches a sword off an Orc as they gallop past.) LEFT! 
 
Merry steers the horse left. They continue to weave in between the Mmakil. They come in between the back legs of one and Eowyn slashes with both swords one on each leg. The Mmakil falls.
 
EOMER:	Aim for the heads! (He fires an arrow at a Mmakils head. It rears up on its back legs roaring.) 
 
THEODEN:	Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!
 
They continue to fire at it, it falls backwards towards Eowyn and Merry. Their horse rears and falls, spilling them off. The Mmakil falls towards Eowyn who manages to avoid been crushed at the last minute by rolling away. 
 
EOWYN:	Merry! 
 
She looks around for him. Some orcs attack her and she fights them fiercly. Theoden sees her fighting. Merry walks out from behind the Mmakil coughing the dust from his throat. A Haradrim sees him and attacks him. Merry fights fiercely killing several Haradrim until one picks him up. Merry doesnt give up and continues to fight. He slashes the Orcs throat and stabs him several times. 
  
Eowyn is fighting Orcs and she fights Gothmog. She punches him and he falls to the floor.
 
 Scene 49

 The  Scene changes over the city of Minas Tirith the Witch King flies over on his fell beast whilst a Troll attacks the locked door with his mace. On the other side of the door Gondor soldiers stand in readiness. Pippin and Gandalf sit at one side together. Pippin looks at Gandalf 
 

PIPPIN:	 I didnt think it would end this way.  
 
GANDALF:	End? No, the journey doesnt end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. (Pippin listens intently) The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass. And then you see it.
 
PIPPIN:	What? Gandalf? See what?
 
GANDALF:	White shores and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise. (He smiles at Pippin.)
 
PIPPIN: 	Well, (he smiles back) thats not so bad.
 
GANDALF: 	No. No it isnt.
 
Back at the door the soldiers are trying to prevent them breaking through. 

Gandalf nods encouragement at Pippin. Pippin closes his eyes, trying to gain more courage.

 Scene 50


Back on the field of battle the Rohirrim continue to fight the Mmakil. 
 
THEODEN: 	Rally to me! To meeee! 
 
He sees the Witch King flying towards him very fast. The fell beast catches up Theoden and his horse in its mouth and throws them both down. Eowyn watches in horror. The fell beast moves towards the stricken horse and rider. 
 
WITCH KING:	 Feast on his flesh.
 
Theoden looks up from the ground, unable to move as he is trapped under the horse. The beast moves towards him. Eowyn moves in front of Theoden to defend him.
 
EOWYN:	 I will kill you if you touch him.
 
WITCH KING:	Do not come between the Nazgl and his prey.
 
The beast lunges at her, she steps aside and cuts off its head. The beast falls down dead. The Witch King turns towards her as she picks up a wooden shield and approaches him. He wields a massive mace. He swings the mace at her and she manages to avoid it several times, but eventually he catches her shattering the shield and breaking her arm. She falls down. He towers over her.
 
 Scene 51


The  Scene changes to the river. Ships are drawing up towards Orcs awaiting them on the shore. 
 
ORC: 	Late as usual, pirate scum. (He pushes his way through the Orcs towards the ships.) Theres knifework here needs doing. Come on you sea rats, get off your ships. 
 
Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas jump off the ship. The Orcs looks surprised. They begin to approach the Orcs.
 
GIMLI: 	Theres plenty for the both of us, may be best Dwarf win! 
 
As they move towards the Orcs the Dead Army materialise behind them and charge at the Orcs who move back in astonishment. The Dead Army overrun the Orcs and kill them all.
 
 Scene 52


Meanwhile on the field of battle, Eowyn looks up at the Witch King. He grabs her by the throat and lifts her up.
 
WITCH KING:	You fool! No man can kill me. Die now!
From behind Merry has crawled unnoticed behind the Witch King, he stabs him behind his knee. The Witch King drops Eowyn and falls to his knees. Merry groans in agony and holds his arm that has stabbed the Witch King, falling back. Eowyn removes her helmet before the Witch King.
 
EOWYN:	I am no man! 
 
She thrusts her sword into the space in his helmet. It sparks, he roars and the sword flies back out. Eowyn falls to the floor as the Witch King folds in on himself, screaming. He disappears.
 
 Scene 53


  Scene changes to Legolas counting as he shoots his arrows.
 

LEGOLAS:	 Fifteen, sixteen. 
 
Aragorn fights fiercely on the battlefield, killing many Orcs. Eowyn crawls towards Theoden.
 
EOWYN:	Merry!
 
Gothmog sees her and limps towards her. She hears him and turns and sees him. She tries to crawl faster as he comes towards her. Aragorn continues to fight, killing many Orcs. Eowyn reaches for Theodens sword but it falls away from her fingers as Gothmog closes in on her. Gimli and Aragorn finish him between them. They are unaware of Eowyn. 
 
ARAGORN:	 Legolas! 
  
He points out a Mmakil coming straight towards them. Legolas runs towards it and jumps onto its tusk, he swings onto its front leg and then onto its back leg. He climbs up arrows that are sticking out of it and gains the top of the animal. He starts to shoot arrows at the occupants.
 
LEGOLAS: 	Thirty three, thirty four.
 
Haradrim run towards them, he fights them off and drops them down off the animal. Legolas grabs a rope and swings down to the side of the animal. He slashes twice at the straps and the whole construction slips sideways tipping off the occupants. Legolas holds onto the rope until he gains the top again then lets go and stands there alone. He moves towards the Mmakils head and fits three arrows to his bow. He fires them down into the Mmakils skull. As the animal drops to the ground, Legolas slides down its trunk to land safely on the ground in front of Gimli. He nods at him.
 
GIMLI:	That still only counts as one! 
 
Aragorn is continuing to fight.
 
ORC: 	Come on then , come on! 
 
He kills all the Orcs around him and stops to look at the battlefield. Behind him the Army of the Dead bring down a Mmakil. He watches as they move through the city killing all the Orcs they can find. 
 
 Scene 54


The  Scene changes to show Eowyn struggling to crawl towards Theoden, who still lies trapped beneath his horse. She reaches him and strokes his face. He puts his gloved hand up to her.
THEODEN:	I know your face, Eowyn. (She smiles.) My eyes darken.
 
Her smiles fades.
 
EOWYN:	No, no. Im going to save you. 
 
THEODEN: 	You already did. Eowyn, my body is broken. You have to let me go. 
 
She shakes her head gently.
 
EOWYN: 	No.
  
THEODEN:	 I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company; I shall not now feel ashamed. 
 
He looks at her.
 
THEODEN: 	 Eowyn. 
 
He dies. 

Eowyn cries. 
 
 Scene 55


Meanwhile back outside the walls of the city, Gandalf and Pippin move forward to look at the Army of the Dead. They stand in front of Aragorn.
KING OF THE DEAD:	Release us! 
 
GIMLI:	Bad idea! Very handy in a tight spot these lads, despite the fact theyre dead.
 
KING OF THE DEAD: 	You gave us your word! 
 
ARAGORN:	I hold your oath fulfilled. Go. Be at peace.
 
The King of the Dead smiles. There is a great wind and the Army of the Dead disappears. Aragorn looks around, he sees Gandalf who bows low to him. Aragorn smiles.
 
 Scene 56


The  Scene changes to show Eomer searching amongst the dead. Pippin also searches. He sees Merrys cloak on the floor and picks it up.
 
PIPPIN: 	Merry!
 
EOMER: 	Nooooo! 
 
He runs towards Eowyns body and picks her up and cradles her in his arms.
 
EOMER:	Nooooooo! Noooooo! 
 
Aragorn hears him and looks across. He sees him cradling Eowyn and a tear starts to his eye.

Gandalf looks on; he nods his head just slightly. 

The  Scene changes to Aragorn entering the Houses of Healing. Eomer sits with Eowyn. Aragorn approaches her. He lifts her damaged arm to look at it. He squeezes water out of a cloth and bathes her head with it. Eomer watches, grief in his eyes. Eowyn begins to breathe heavily, she opens her eyes and looks at Aragorn. 

As he ministers to her a song plays over all.
With a sigh, you turn away,
With a deepening heart no words to say
You will find that the world has changed forever.

Eowyn has recovered, she moves over to a window as the song continues, Faramir watches her. 

And the trees are now turning from green to gold,
And the sun is now fading, I wish I could hold you closer. 

 Scene 57


 It is night time and Pippin continues to search for Merry on the battlefield.
 

PIPPIN:	 Merry! (He shouts him.)
  
Pippin turns around and spots Merry half concealed beneath an Orc. He rolls the Orc off the top of him. 
 
PIPPIN:	Merry! (He picks him up in his arms.) Merry its me. (Merry opens his eyes and looks at him, there is blood at the corner of is mouth.) Its Pippin! (He cries.) 
 
MERRY:	I knew youd find me.
 
PIPPIN:	Yes. 
 
MERRY: 	Are you going to leave me?
 
PIPPIN:	No Merry, Im going to look after you. 
 
He picks up Merrys cloak and covers him with it. 
 
 Scene 58


The  Scene changes to show the tower of Cirith Ungol. The camera zooms into the window at the top of the tower. Frodo lies semi-naked on the ground with his hands bound in front of him. He has the remains of some spiderwebs still wrapped around him.

Frodo wakes up and hears voices behind him. Shagrat and Gorbag, two Orcs are sorting through Frodos belongings. Shagrat picks up Frodos mithril shirt and turns it about in the light admiring it. Gorbag sees him.
 
GORBAG:	Hands off! That shiny shirt, thats mine! 
Frodo is listening to them. 
SHAGRAT:	Its going to the Great Eye, along with everything else. 
 
Frodo realises what Shagrat is saying and feels in panic for the Ring on its chain around his neck. It is gone.
 
GORBAG:	I dont take orders from stinking Morgul-rats! 
 
He pushes Shagrat against the wall. Shagrat pulls out a sword.
 
SHAGRAT:	You touch it and Ill stick this blade in your gut!
 
He threatens him with his sword. Shagrat and Gorbag begin to grapple. Eventually Shagrat falls across the trapdoor. Gorbag stamps on him pushing him through the trapdoor. He falls down the stairs eventually landing amongst the partying Orcs below. Gorbag shouts down to them.
 
GORBAG:	 The scum tried to knife me. Kill him! 
 
They try to attack Shagrat who knocks an Orc out of the window to land far below. The Orcs at the bottom of the tower see him land, and react. They begin to fight amongst themselves.

Meanwhile we see Sam moving up towards the tower. He can hear the Orcs fighting. Sam creeps up to the tower entrance. All the Orcs seem to be dead. He starts to run through the tower looking about him with Sting and his own sword, one in each hand. He runs up the stairs to the higher levels. He sees some Orcs coming so he begins to roar at them to pluck up his courage. His shadow looks huge on the wall. When he emerges from the stairwell the Orcs see he is only small and move to attack him. But Sam is too quick. He stabs the first one.
 
SAM: 	Thats for Frodo!
 
He approaches the second one and stabs him knocking him off the stairs.
 
SAM: 	And the Shire!
 
He pushes the third one over the edge of the stairs and shouts after him.
 
SAM:	And thats for my old gaffer!
 
Sam continues on up the stairs. We see Gorbag escaping with Frodos mithril shirt. 

The  Scene changes to show Frodo in the top of the tower. He is struggling with his bonds to try to escape. Shagrat appears behind him.
 
SHAGRAT: 	Stop your squealing you dunghill rat! 
 
He pulls out a knife. 
 
SHAGRAT:	Im gonna bleed you like a stuck pig! 
 
He cries out suddenly and a blue blade sticks out through his chest. Sam appears behind him.
 
SAM:	Not if I stick you first! 
 
FRODO:	Sam! 
 
Sam pushes Shagrat off his sword. He drops the sword and kneels down in front of Frodo.
 
FRODO:	Oh Sam, Im so sorry. Sorry for everything.
 
Sam smiles at him.
 
SAM: 	Lets get you out of here. (He starts to help Frodo get the ropes off his hands.)
 
FRODO: 	Its too late. Its over. Theyve taken it Sam, they took the Ring! (He sits up and looks at Sam.)
 
SAM:	Begging your pardon but they havent.
 
Sam stands up. He pulls the Ring out of his pocket and holds it out on its chain in front of Frodo.
 
SAM:	I thought Id lost you. So I took it, only for safekeeping. (He offers Frodo the Ring on the chain.)
 
FRODO:	Give it to me! (As Frodo reaches for the Ring Sam pulls it back.) Give me the Ring Sam. (Sam looks strange when Frodo speaks to him he sounds far away.) Sam! Give me the Ring. (Sam continues to struggle, but he offers the Ring to Frodo who snatches it from him. Frodo puts it back around his neck.) You must understand. The Ring is my burden. It will destroy you Sam. 
 
Frodo holds onto the wall to steady himself. Sam stands watching him a suspicious expression on his face.
 
SAM: 	Come on Mr Frodo. Wed best find you some clothes. You cant go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin. 
 
The  Scene changes to show Frodo and Sam leaving the tower fully clothed in disguise as Orcs. They stand and survey the  Scene below them. They can see Mount Orodruin and the Tower of Barad Dr. But between they can see many, many campfires of the enemy soldiers. There are thousands of them between them and the mountain. 
 
SAM: 	We did it Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor. 
 
FRODO:	There are so many of them. Well never get through unseen. 
 
Frodo sees the Eye of Sauron surveying the soldiers from the top of Barad Dr. He staggers back slightly.
 
FRODO:	Its Him, the Eye!
 
The camera shows the Eye of Sauron cradled in its tower. Frodo looks at Sam.
 
SAM:	We have to go in there Mr Frodo. Theres nothing for it. (Frodo looks at him uncertain.) Come on lets just make it down the hill for starters. 
 
Frodo walks in front as they head off down the hill
 
 Scene 59


Gandalf is talking to Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Eomer in the Great Hall of Minas Tirith. 
 
GANDALF:	Frodo has passed beyond my sight. (He walks across the hall.) The darkness is deepening. 
 
ARAGORN:	If Sauron had the Ring we would know it. 
 
GANDALF:	 Its only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.
 
GIMLI:	Let him stay there! Let him rot! Why should we care?
 
GANDALF:	Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.
 
Gimli ponders Gandalfs words.
 
GANDALF: 	Ive sent him to his death. 
 
Aragorn turns to him.
 
ARAGORN:	No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that. 
 
GIMLI: 	How?
 
ARAGORN:	Draw out Saurons armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. 
 
Gimli chokes on his pipe. 
 
EOMER:	We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. 
 
ARAGORN:	Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Saurons eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves. 
 
LEGOLAS:	A diversion. 
 
GIMLI:	Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for? 
 
GANDALF:	Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait.
 
ARAGORN: 	Oh, I think he will. 

 Scene 60


Aragorn is alone. He walks towards the Palantir and uncovers it. He closes his eyes, picks it up in one hand and holds it up in front of his face. He opens his eyes and looks into it, facing the Eye of Sauron which is speaking in Black speech.
 
ARAGORN:	Long have you hunted me. Long have I eluded you. No more! (He puts Anduril up in front of the Palantir.) Behold, the Sword of Elendil! 
 
Sauron appears in the pupil of the Eye. He shows Aragorn Arwen who is dying. Aragorn is horrified and steps back from the Palantir. The Evenstar falls from his neck and shatters on the ground. 

The  Scene changes to show Aragorn wearing the emblems of the White Tree and the Seven Stars with the Crown above them as he leads an army from Minas Tirith. 

Everyone is there. Pippin rides in front of Gandalf. Merry rides behind Eomer. 
 
 Scene 61


 
The  Scene changes to show the Houses of Healing. Eowyn looks out over the city.
 

EOWYN:	 The City has fallen silent. There is no warmth left in the sun.
   
Faramir walks up behind her. 
 
EOWYN:	It grows so cold.
 
Faramir approaches her. 
 
FARAMIR:	Its just the damp of the first spring rain. 
 
She looks at him. He looks deep into her eyes and smiles.
 
FARAMIR:	I do not believe this darkness will endure. 
 
He holds her hand and she leans her head on his shoulder. They stand looking out over the city together. 
 
 Scene 62


Frodo and Sam arrive on the plains of Gorgoroth. A horn sounds.
 
SAM:	Look! The Orcs, theyre moving off! 
 
All the Orcs are marching away.
 
SAM:	You see Mr Frodo some luck at last!
 
ORC: 	Move it, you slugs! 
 
They turn around to see a band of Orcs heading towards them from behind.
 
ORC:	Come on! Faster! 
 
Frodo and Sam have nowhere to hide. They move to the side of the road and sit down. Hoping that they will not be seen. 
 
ORC:	Come along you scum! (The Orcs move closer) Ill whip you down to the bone! Come on! What have I told you. (They begin to pass by Frodo and Sam. One of the captains spots Frodo and Sam.) Get up! (He whips them.) Come on you slugs! You two are going straight to the front line! Move it, come on! Fall in! Move it! Move it! Move it! 
 
He pushes Frodo and Sam in amongst the other Orcs. 
  
ORC: 	To the gate you slugs, now move it! (The Orcs and Frodo and Sam continue to march towards the Gate.) Dont you know were at war? 
 
The  Scene changes to show Aragorn followed by the army advancing towards the Black Gate. 

It changes back to show the Orcs drumming and marching towards the Black Gate. 
 
ORC: 	Company halt! Inspection! 
 
Frodo starts to sink to the ground!
 
FRODO: 	Sam! Help me! 
 
SAM:	Mr Frodo! (He tries to help him.) 
 
One of the Orc generals sees them and comes towards them.
 
SAM:	Stand up Mr Frodo. Stand up!
 
FRODO:	Its so heavy! 
 
The General continues to come closer to them. He looks straight at Sam, roars at him and pushes through the Orcs towards them.
 
SAM:	Oh no! What do I do? (He looks around.) What do I do? 
 
FRODO:	Hit me! Hit me Sam! Start fighting! 
 
SAM: 	Get off of me! (He pushes Frodo.) Nobody pushes me you filthy maggot! (They are fighting. Frodo punches Sam.) Get off of me! 
 
The Orc captain comes over to them.
 
ORC:	Break it up! Break it up!
 
The General speaks to the Orc captain.
 
GENERAL:	Oy! Ill have your guts if you dont shut this rabble down! 
 
The captain turns towards him.
 
FRODO: 	 Go Sam. Now! (Frodo and Sam sneak away amongst the confusion. They manage to hide.)
 
The General is looking for them but cannot see them.
 
GENERAL:	Move along scum! (He tramps off.)
 
CAPTAIN:	Get back in the line you maggots! Get back in the line you slugs! 
 
We see Frodo and Sam escaping over the rugged terrain. 
 
 Scene 63


We see Frodo and Sam moving over the rugged plains of Gorgoroth. They continue to walk all day long growing ever closer to the mountain. They begin to climb upwards amongst the rocks. Frodo falls down between them. He removes his helmet. 
 
FRODO:	I cant! I cant I cant manage the Ring Sam. Its its such a weight to carry. Its such a weight. (Frodo is gasping for breath. Sam removes his helmet and looks back at him.)
 
SAM:	(Pointing towards the mountain.) Were going that way, straight as we can. Theres no point carrying anything were not sure to need. 
 
They throw away all the Orc gear and camping gear. 

Sam is sitting shivering. Frodo sleeps. Sam looks up.
 
SAM:	Mr Frodo, look. (We can see a star peeping through the clouds.) There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch. (He turns to look at Frodo, who still sits with his eyes closed, twitching. The Eye of Sauron is roving over the land; they sit in a cleft in the rocks unseen.)
 
The  Scene changes to show Aragorn and the army closing up to the Black Gate. It changes back to Frodo desperately trying to get some water out of his water bottle. He is gasping and struggling. There is no water. He gives up. Sam comes over and offers his water bottle.
 
SAM:	Take mine. (He gives him the bottle.) Theres a few drops left. 
 
Frodo drinks the last drops of water. There is a strange light in his eyes.
 
FRODO:	There will be none left for the return journey. 
 
SAM: 	I dont think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo. 
 
Frodo turns and looks at him. Sam grabs his hand and pulls him up.

The  Scene changes to show the Gondorian soldiers arraying before the Black gate. Aragorn rides to the front of them with Gandalf and Legolas. 

The  Scene changes back to Frodo and Sam trudging along in Mordor. Frodo tries to ward off the Eye as he walks. Sam watches him. Frodo lifts his eyes and turns towards the Eye of Sauron. It is approaching them.
 
SAM:	Frodo, get down! (He dives down onto the ground. Frodo continues to turn and look towards the eye.) Hide! 
 
Frodo sees the Eye, turns away from it and collapses down to the ground.
 
SAM:	 Frodo! 
 
Frodo lies on the ground, his eyes open, as the Eye of Sauron passes them by and moves on. 
 

 Scene 64


The  Scene changes to show the army outside the gate.
 
PIPPIN:	Where are they?
 
Aragorn turns to look towards him and then rides forward towards the gate with Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer and a Gondorian standard bearer. They ride up close to the gate.

The  Scene changes to show Frodo pinned unable to move for fear of the Eye. 
 
ARAGORN:	Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! (He shouts at the Gate.) Let justice be done upon him! (Merry and Gimli watch from behind their riders. The gates open and out comes Saurons Lieutenant. He rides towards them.)
 
MOUTH OF SAURON:	My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome. 
 
Aragorn and Legolas look at him aghast. He is horrific to look at. 
 
MOUTH OF SAURON: 	Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?
 
GANDALF:	We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed. Tell your master this. The armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return. 
 
MOUTH OF SAURON:	Aha! Old Greybeard! I have a token I was bidden to show thee. (He holds up Frodos mithril shirt in front of Gandalf.) 
 
PIPPIN:	Frodo!
 
The Mouth of Sauron throws the shirt at Gandalf. 
 
PIPPIN: 	Frodo!
 
GANDALF: 	Silence!
 
MERRY:	No! 
 
GANDALF:	Silence!
 
MOUTH OF SAURON:	The Halfling was dear to thee I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who wouldve thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did Gandalf, he did. 
 
Tears start into Gandalfs eyes. 

Aragorn moves forward on his horse.
 
MOUTH OF SAURON: 	And who is this? Isildurs heir? It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade. 
 
Aragorn sweeps out his sword and beheads the Mouth of Sauron in one movement. 
 
GIMLI:	I guess that concludes negotiations. 
 
ARAGORN:	 I do not believe it. I will not.

 Scene 65

 
 Scene changes to show the Eye of Sauron. Frodo is pinned unable to move in case it sees him. 

 Scene moves back to the gate which begins to open. Aragorn turns to look at it. Orcs begin to march through
 .

ARAGORN:	 Pull back! Pull back!
   
They ride back towards the army with the Orcs marching behind them. 

The  Scene changes back to Frodo and Sam.
 
SAM:	Its gone Mr Frodo. The lights passed on, away towards the North. Somethings drawn its gaze.
 
Frodo gets up slowly. Sam helps him.

The  Scene changes back to the gate.

The soldiers look uncertain as the Orcs march towards them.
 
ARAGORN:	Hold your ground! Hold your ground! 
 
He rides across the front of the army addressing them.
 
ARAGORN:	Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. (They listen to him.) I see it in your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! 
 
The men look encouraged.
 
ARAGORN:	By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the West!
 
The soldiers all unsheath their weapons and stand ready. Aragorn wheels around on his horse to face the oncoming enemy. 

The  Scene changes to show Sam and Frodo struggling up the rocky feet of Mount Doom. They both stumble and lie helpless on the ground as the Mountain spews forth balls of lava. 

Back at the gate we are shown the small Gondorian army being surrounded by the huge Orc army. Aragorn looks at them.

Frodo looks up from the ground, his eyes bloodshot he looks up at the summit of Mount Doom. He grits his teeth and groaning he struggles to move forward. He crawls on his hands and knees past Sam who is lying on his back. He falls down again on his face.

At the gate Pippin unsheathes his sword, Merry looks at him and breathes heavily, holding himself in readiness for battle. Eomer looks menacing at the Orc army. 

We can see that the army has completely surrounded the Gondorians. 
 
GIMLI:	 Never thought Id die fighting side by side with an elf. 
 
LEGOLAS:	What about side by side with a friend? (He looks down at Gimli and smiles. Gimli looks up at him.) 
 
GIMLI:	Aye! I could do that.
 
 Scene 66

 	 
Meanwhile Sam crawls over to Frodo and picks him up turning him over. He looks up at the mountain and begins to cry. He holds Frodo cradled in his arms and looks down at him.
 
SAM:	Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He is crying.) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields, (Frodo opens his eyes and looks at him.) and eating the first of the strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? 
 
Frodo looks at him.
 
FRODO:	No Sam. I cant recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the touch of grass. Im naked in the dark. Theres theres nothing, no veil between me and the wheel of fire. (He begins to panic.) I can see him with my waking eyes! 
 
SAM:	Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I cant carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on! (he shouts.) 
 
Sam picks Frodo up and puts him across his shoulder he staggers forward, gets his balance and begins to move up the mountain step by step.
 
 	 
 Scene 67

 	 
Aragorn stands in readiness in front of the army. (The Eye of Sauron whispers his name to him.)
 
EYE OF SAURON:	Aragorn! (Aragorn moves forward seeming mesmerised.) Elessar! (Aragorns sword arm drops to his side. He turns and looks at Gandalf, who holds up Frodos mithril shirt for him to see. Aragorn smiles.)
 
ARAGORN:	For Frodo. 
 
He raises his sword and runs forward towards the Orc army. Pippin and Merry shout and run after him, their swords raised. The rest of the army start to run towards the Orcs. They quickly overtake the Hobbits. Aragorn reaches the Orcs and smashes into them slashing with his sword. The two armies collide in a fierce battle. 
 
 Scene 68

 	 
Sam is carrying Frodo. He is struggling up some huge boulders that look a little like steps. He rounds a huge boulder and looks up to see a doorway.
 
SAM:	Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! Were almost there! 
 
Suddenly Gollum appears on top of the huge boulder.
 
GOLLUM:	Clever Hobbits to climb so high! (Sam looks up and sees him, but Gollum drops on Frodos back on top of Sam. They struggle, but Sam falls back, dropping Frodo. Gollum tries to grapple with Frodo and gets his hands around his throat.) Mustnt go that way. Mustnt hurt the precious!
 
FRODO:	You swore! You swore on the precious! 
 
Gollum mocks him.
 
FRODO:	Smeagol promised! 
 
GOLLUM:	Smeagol lied! (He squeezes Frodos throat.) 
 
Sam recovers from his fall and picks up a rock. He throws it at Gollum and hits him on the head. Gollum falls off Frodo who holds his throat, gasping. Gollum holds his head and makes his way back to Frodo. He growls at Frodo as he about to pounce on him, but Sam launches himself at Gollum and they roll away down the hill.

Back on the battlefield we see all the heroes fiercely fighting off the Orcs. The Ringwraiths come to join in the battle.

Sam is fighting with Gollum. Gollum bangs Sams head on the ground and bites his neck!
 
SAM:	AAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhh!
 
He pushes Gollum off and as he gets up he draws his sword and slashes Gollum across his belly. 
 
GOLLUM:	AAAAAHH
 
Sam turns around looking for Frodo.
 
SAM:	(shouts) Frodo!
 
We see Frodo running up the last part of the mountain, determination on his face.

 Scene 69

 Gandalf and Legolas continue to fight the Orcs. There is a scream from the Ringwraiths and Gandalf stops to look up at one who is closing in on him. Gandalf sees a moth flitting around him and looks up again to see a huge eagle intercept the fell beast and drag it off.
 .

PIPPIN:	The eagles! The eagles are coming! 
   
The eagles engage in the air with the fell beasts.
 
 	 
 Scene 70

 	 
Sam looks and sees Frodo making the last run to the door. He goes in. Sam follows Frodo and walks along the pathway into Mount Doom.
 
SAM:	Frodo! (He shouts.)
 
Frodo is standing on the edge of the pathway looking down into the Cracks of Doom. He turns.
 
FRODO:	Im here Sam! (His voice sounds strong. Sam moves slowly towards him.)
 
SAM:	Destroy it! 
 
Frodo looks away. He holds the Ring out in front of him on its chain, watching it. 
 
SAM:	Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire!
 
Frodo is struggling with himself. He stands looking at the Ring. He looks down into the Cracks of Doom gasping and hesitating.
 
SAM:	What are you waiting for? Just let it go!
 
The Ring seems to speak to Frodo. Frodo holds the Ring in front of his eyes. His eyes look mad. The Ring fills all his vision. He turns to look at Sam. He looks mad. 
 
FRODO:	The Ring is mine! (He pulls it off its chain)
 
SAM:	No! (Frodo puts it on his finger and disappears.)
 
SAM:	Nooooooo!
 
The Eye of Sauron moves instantly to Mount Doom, aware of him. The Ringwraiths turn away from the battle and speed towards the mountain. 

We can see Frodos footsteps on the pathway. Gollum appears behind Sam. He knocks him down with a rock and looks around. Gollum sees Frodos footsteps. He drops the rock and jumps onto Frodos invisible shoulders. Frodo cries out.

Aragorn is fighting on the battlefield, he hears a roar and turns around, a Cave troll is there and it attacks Aragorn. Aragorn fights the Cave troll desperately.

Gollum is on Frodos shoulders struggling with him. Sam tries to get up but cannot. Gollum puts something up to his mouth and bites hard. Frodo appears screaming. Gollum dances about while Frodo holds his hand.

Aragorn falls down and Legolas sees he is in trouble he tries to reach him.

Frodo falls down and we can see he has half his finger missing. It is bleeding he holds it gasping. Gollum holds up the Ring in his hands and looks up at it. He is mesmerised by the Ring and staggers back towards the brink. 

Aragorn turns around and the Cave troll is striding towards him. Legolas is desperately trying to reach Aragorn to help him. 

Gollum laughs.
 
GOLLUM:	Yeees! (Frodo sees him.) Yeees! (Frodo advances on him.) Precious! My Precious! (Gollum dances about with glee. Frodo attacks him and grapples with him for the Ring.)
 
The troll puts its foot on top of Aragorn. He takes out his knife and stabs the foot. Gandalf looks.

Frodo continues to grapple with Gollum on the edge. They take a step too far and topple over. Gollum has the Ring in his hand and he is falling down into the Cracks of Doom. He holds the Ring to his chest protectively. He hits the lava and begins to sink. He holds his hand up in the air, his head disappears and the arm follows. The Ring sits upon the top of the lava. 

Frodo is hanging on the edge of the rock, holding on with his good hand. Sam dives towards him. He tries to reach him.
 
SAM:	Give me your hand. 
 
Frodo looks up at him. The Ring begins to glow.
 
SAM:	Take my hand. 
 
Frodo tries to reach him and misses.
 
SAM:	No! (Frodo swings back down. He looks desperately up at Sam.) Dont you let go! Dont let go! Reeeaaach! (With one last desperate attempt Frodo swings his arm up and reaches for Sams hand. Sam grasps his damaged hand. The Ring sinks below the lava.)
 
 Scene 71

 	 
The Eye of Sauron flares suddenly. It looks this way and that desperately. The Cave Troll stops, looks towards the Eye, realises it is free and runs off.

Gandalf turns towards the Eye which is screeching and groaning with a terrible sound. Legolas and Aragorn turn to look too. The tower of Barad Dr begins to collapse. Gandalf has tears in his eyes. They watch as the tower collapses to the ground. The Eye of Sauron explodes sending a huge shockwave outwards. 
 
MERRY:	Frodo! (He shouts.) Frodo! (He is gleeful.) 
 
Gimli shakes his hands with joy. 

The Black gate begins to collapse. Orcs try to run away, but the ground below them gives way. They are all destroyed. 

Mount Doom erupts. Merry looks shocked. Gandalf begins to cry. The Ringwraiths fizzle and disappear. Aragorn watches with concern. Pippin cries.
 
PIPPIN:	Frodo.
 

 Scene 72

 	 
Frodo and Sam run along the pathway leaving the mountain as it erupts around them. They escape and manage to jump a chasm onto a high rock, avoiding the lava flow which pursues them.

Frodo stands still, his eyes look clear again.
 
FRODO:	Its gone. (Sam looks at him.) Its done.
 
SAM:	Yes Mr Frodo. Its over now.
 
There is a crash and the ground lurches making them fall off balance. They struggle further up the rock. Frodo collapses onto his back. We can see the lava flow moving all around them. 

Frodo is lying back with his eyes closed.
 
FRODO:	I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalfs fireworks. The lights on the party tree.
 
SAM:	Rosie Cotton dancing. (He has tears in his eyes.) She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have been her. (He cries) It wouldve been her. 
 
Frodo gets up and puts his arm around Sam comfortingly. Sam is crying. Frodo puts his head on Sams.
 
FRODO:	 Im glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee here at the end of all things. They hug.
 
Sometime later Sam and Frodo are lying prone on the rock. In the distance eagles appear flying towards them. Gandalf is on the back of one. They fly in and pick Frodo and Sam up carefully in their claws. We can see Frodo lying back with his eyes closed.

 Scene 73

The  Scene changes and Frodo is still lying back with his eyes closed but he is in a bed. We can hear birds singing. Frodo wakes up and sits up in the bed. He looks and sees Gandalf sitting at the bottom of his bed.
 .

FRODO:	Gandalf? 
   
Gandalf smiles at him, his eyes twinkle and he begins to laugh. 
 
FRODO:	Oooohhh! (He laughs with Gandalf.)
 
Merry and Pippin come to the door they are pleased to see him.
 
MERRY:	Frodo! 
 
They run towards him and leap on the bed. Gandalf laughs at them. They are laughing and hugging each other, pleased to meet up again. 

Gimli comes through the door and spreads his arms.
 
GIMLI:	Aaaahh! 
 
FRODO:	Gimli! 
 
Gimli claps his hands and strides towards him.

Legolas comes to the door he smiles at Frodo and Frodo smiles back. 

Aragorn comes through the door.
 
FRODO:	Aragorn! 
 
Aragorn smiles at him. They all stand by the bed and Gimli wipes away a stray tear. 

Finally Sam appears at the door, he looks warily at Frodo. Frodo sees him and smiles, Sam smiles back.
 
 Scene 74

 	 
The  Scene changes to Minas Tirith. In the courtyard everyone is gathered. 

Aragorn is being crowned King. He stands on the steps to the hall. Gandalf lifts the crown high and then places it on Aragorns head. 
 
GANDALF:	Now come the days of the King. May they be blessed.
 
He moves back and Aragorn walks up the steps and turns towards the people. They all clap and cheer. 
 
ARAGORN:	This day does not belong to one man, but to all. Let us together rebuild this world, that we may share in the days of peace. 
 
The people cheer and clap again. Gimli looks up in wonder as petals fall down upon them. 

Aragorn begins to sing the song of Elendil. 
 
ARAGORN:	Et Erello Endorenna utlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn Ambar-metta! (Out if the great sea to Middle Earth I am come. In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the end of the world.) 
 
He walks down towards the people. 

Faramir and Eowyn bow low to him. Eomer, who is now King of Rohan also bows low to him. The elves approach him and he puts his hand on Legolas shoulder. 
 
ARAGORN:	Hannon le. (Thank you.) 
 
Legolas smiles and indicates behind him with his eyes. Aragorn looks behind Legolas. He sees a banner with a white tree. Arwen appears from behind it. Elrond whispers to Arwen from behind. She moves forward towards Aragorn. Aragorn moves towards her. He takes the banner from her. She has tears in her eyes and she lowers her head. He lifts her face towards him holding her chin. She smiles at him. Aragorn looks at her and then clasps her in a passionate kiss, lifting her up and turning around with her as he does so. Everyone claps and Elrond smiles. They kiss again tenderly. Arwen laughs and clasps him to her.

They walk hand in hand and come to the Hobbits. They all bow to him.
 
ARAGORN:	My friends, (they look at him.) you bow to no-one. 
 
He kneels down in front of them and everyone kneels with him. The Hobbits look most embarrassed. 

The camera pans back from Minas Tirith and the picture changes to that of a map.
 
 	 
 Scene 75

 	 
FRODO:	(voice over as we move over the map.) And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle Earth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring, though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended. (the map ends on the Shire.) 

Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. 
 
The Hobbits are on horseback riding through the Shire.
 
FRODO:	We were home. 
 
They see Everard Proudfoot
 
PIPPIN:	Alright! 
 
Frodo nods at him. Sam and Merry also nod at him. He shakes his head in disapproval of them. 

The  Scene changes to The Green Dragon. A Hobbit is carrying a huge pumpkin. Frodo has four drinks in his hands. He moves out of the way.
 
HOBBIT:	Hey watch the pumpkin.
 
Frodo puts the drinks on the table for the others. They are serious whilst the rest of the Hobbits are their usual jovial selves, laughing and joking about the pumpkin.

Frodo looks at the others. The camera rests on each of the four Hobbits showing how the experiences they have been through have changed them and made them more serious. They pick up their mugs, clang them together, smile and drink. 

Sam looks over at Rosie behind the bar.
 
ROSIE:	Goodnight lads. 
 
She is gathering up dirty mugs and serving. Sam takes a long drink from his mug and gets up and goes towards her. The other Hobbits watch him. Pippin raises his eyebrows and smiles. Merry blows out through pursed lips and looks at him smiling. Frodo laughs.

The  Scene changes. Sam is kissing Rosie at their wedding. She has ribbons in her hair. They smile at each other and look at the wedding guests. Frodo, Merry and Pippin are clapping. Rosie throws her bouquet and Pippin catches it. He looks at the lady hobbit standing next to him, raises his eyebrows and smiles at her. 
 
PIPPIN:	Hmm? 
 
Everyone is happy and smiling. The camera rests on Frodos happy, smiling face. He becomes serious and the  Scene changes to him in Bag End. 
 
FRODO:	How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back? There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken hold.
 
Frodo is writing at the writing table. He is writing in Bilbos book. We see the title page. there and back again a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins. He adds something to it. We hear a door open. Frodo frowns and grasps his shoulder. Sam comes into the room from behind.
 
SAM:	Mr Frodo? What is it? (He puts the books he has been carrying down on the desk.)

 
FRODO:	Its been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam. Its never really healed. 
 
Sam notices the book in front of Frodo.
 
SAM:	(reading) There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished it.
 
He looks at Frodo who closes the book. 
 
FRODO:	Not quite. Theres room for a little more. (He looks at Sam.)
 
 Scene 76
 

The  Scene changes to show the four hobbits waiting for an approaching cart by the lake in Hobbiton. 
 
FRODO:	Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. That each of us must come and go in the telling. Bilbos story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him. (They approach the cart, Gandalf is driving it.) save one. 
 
The  Scene changes to show the cart travelling through the countryside. 
 
BILBO:	Tell me again lad, where are we going?
 
FRODO:	To the harbour Bilbo. The elves have accorded you a special honour. A place on the last ship to leave Middle Earth. 
 
Frodo and Bilbo are sitting together in the cart. 
 
BILBO:	Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you?
 
Frodo looks away.
 
FRODO:	Im sorry uncle. Im afraid I lost it. 
 
BILBO:	Oh, pity. (He sighs.) I would have like to have held it one last time. 
 
The  Scene changes to the Grey Havens. The five Hobbits walk forward with Gandalf behind them. Frodo and Sam help Bilbo. Bilbo raises his eyes.
 
BILBO:	Oh! Well here is a sight I have never seen before. 
 
The camera moves behind showing the sea and a ship drawn up to the jetty. Some elves stand there ready to greet them. Bilbo bows to them. It is Elrond, Celeborn and Galadriel. They bow back. 
 
GALADRIL:	The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the dominion of men. 
 
ELROND:	 I Aear cn ven na mar. (The sea calls us home.)
 
Bilbo smiles and Elrond spreads him arms out to him. 
 
BILBO:	I think Im quite ready for another adventure. 
 
He walks towards the ship. Elrond puts his arm around him protectively as they walk onto the ship. Galadriel smiles at them and gets on the ship. Frodo watches intensely. Celeborn also boards the ship.

Gandalf moves forward and turns to them.
 
GANDALF:	Farewell my brave Hobbits. (He smiles. They look at him with tears in their eyes.) My work is now finished. (Frodo is not crying.) Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. (Merry and Pippin are crying.) I will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil. (He walks towards the ship. Frodo is watching him, he stops and turns towards them.) It is time Frodo. 
 
The three Hobbits turn towards Frodo. He looks at them. 
 
SAM:	What does he mean? 
 
FRODO:	We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved, but not for me. 
 
SAM:	(tearfully) You dont mean that. You cant leave.
 
Frodo looks away, he brings up the book and hands it to Sam. Sam takes it.
 
FRODO:	The last pages are for you Sam. (Sam cries)
 
Merry is crying, Frodo hugs him. He hugs Pippin who is also crying. He turns away from them towards Sam who is also crying. Frodo clasps him in a farewell hug. Frodo lets him go and kisses him on his head. He turns towards Gandalf who beckons him with his hand. Once on board the ship Frodo turns and smiles beamingly at them. He turns away. The ship glides silently out of the bay into the sunset.

Merry and Pippin turn away. Sam watches the ship disappear into the distance then turns away too.

Back in Hobbiton Sam walks towards his home. His daughter runs out of the door to meet him. He gathers her up in his arms.
 
FRODO VOICE OVER:	My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. (Rosie comes out of the door towards him holding a young baby.) You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in the story will go on. (Sam kisses Rosie.) 
 
SAM:	Well, Im back.
 
They turn and go into their home.
