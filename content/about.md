I am a Ph.D. candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston University. Inside the lab, I think about why humans learn differently from one another. Outside the lab, I scour the internet for vintage clothes and eat as much Korean fried chicken as I can afford after buying vintage clothes.

The name of this site is dedicated to a [friend, colleague, and mentor](/pdfs/Legacy-Adam-Johnson.pdf).
