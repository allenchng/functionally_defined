This summer I had the opportunity to do an internship in data science at the advertising technology company MediaMath. The experience was challenging, educational, and a lot of fun. My project was to investigate methods of probabilistic programming for ad conversion prediction and to deliver a viable method that could be used for production. I had the chance to write about the outcomes of my work and to be the first post in MediaMath's new data science blog. You can read all about my experiments in Python, TensorFlow, and machine learning in the link below.
