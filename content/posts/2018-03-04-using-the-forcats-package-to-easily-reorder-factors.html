<p>Like all programmers, I strive to make my code efficient and easily readable. I hope that the results are somewhat close to those two ideals, but I know that there are always better ways to code things (this xkcd hits alarmingly close to home for me…)</p>

<p>That being said, I’m always happy to stumble into R packages or snippets of code that can help me become more efficient in writing code and I do my best to remind myself to try and use these methods in the future. To that end, I thought I would write a short post today about a package that I recently learned about, forcats. The focats package is based around working with factors and integrates easily with the tidyverse. In particular, it has a nice function called fct_reorder that lets you reorder the levels of one factor using the rank order of another variable. When I saw this, my mind immediately jumped back to trying to order factor levels for plotting and how clunky my code had been at the time. I decided to go back and just rewrite some lines of my code to integrate the <strong>fct_reorder</strong> function into my coding bag of tricks.</p>
<p>I’m going to be revisiting some code I wrote in my second ever <a href="https://functionallydefined.netlify.com/posts/daily_wear/">post</a> looking at my clothing trends.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>In the original post, you can see that I first summarised the number of times each clothing maker was worn, then reordered the maker variable outside of my dplyr chain.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wear_tbl &lt;- read_csv(&quot;../../data/daily_wear.csv&quot;)

df &lt;- wear_tbl %&gt;% 
  filter(!Maker == &quot;NA&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(maker_up = toupper(Maker)) %&gt;%
  group_by(maker_up) %&gt;%
  summarise(timesworn = n()) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(timesworn))

df$maker_up &lt;- factor(df$maker_up, levels = df$maker_up[order(df$timesworn)])
df$timesworn &lt;- as.numeric(df$timesworn)</code></pre>
<p>To eliminate that step, I can just add one line mutating the maker variable and reordering it based on the number of timesworn.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wear_tbl &lt;- read_csv(&quot;../../data/daily_wear.csv&quot;)

g &lt;- wear_tbl %&gt;% 
  filter(!Maker == &quot;NA&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(maker_up = toupper(Maker)) %&gt;%
  group_by(maker_up) %&gt;%
  summarise(timesworn = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(maker_up = fct_reorder(factor(maker_up), timesworn, .desc = TRUE)) 

g %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=maker_up, y=timesworn)) + 
  geom_point(col=&quot;tomato3&quot;, size=3) +   # Draw points
  geom_segment(aes(x=maker_up, 
                  xend=maker_up, 
                   y=min(timesworn), 
                   yend=max(timesworn)), 
               linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;, 
               size=0.1) +   # Draw dashed lines
  labs(title=&quot;Number of wears for each maker&quot;, 
       subtitle=&quot;Sep. 15, 2017 - Dec. 15, 2017&quot;, 
       caption=&quot;source: me&quot;,
       x = &quot;Maker&quot;,
       y = &quot;Count&quot;) +  
  coord_flip()</code></pre>

<p>That’s it! The fct_reorder function can also be used with other summary measures as well. I’m going to do my best to make sure that I use this the next time I’m working with factors.</p>
