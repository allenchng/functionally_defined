Like all programmers, I strive to make my code efficient and easily readable. I hope that the results are somewhat close to those two ideals, but I know that there are always better ways to code things (this xkcd hits alarmingly close to home for me...)

That being said, I'm always happy to stumble into R packages or snippets of code that can help me become more efficient in writing code and I do my best to remind myself to try and use these methods in the future. To that end, I thought I would write a short post today about a package that I recently learned about, forcats. The focats package is based around working with factors and integrates easily with the tidyverse. In particular, it has a nice function called fct_reorder that lets you reorder the levels of one factor using the rank order of another variable. When I saw this, my mind immediately jumped back to trying to order factor levels for plotting and how clunky my code had been at the time. I decided to go back and just rewrite some lines of my code to integrate the **fct_reorder** function into my coding bag of tricks. 

I'm going to be revisiting some code I wrote in my second ever [post](https://functionallydefined.netlify.com/posts/daily_wear/) looking at my clothing trends. 


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
```

In the original post, you can see that I first summarised the number of times each clothing maker was worn, then reordered the maker variable outside of my dplyr chain. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
wear_tbl <- read_csv("../../data/daily_wear.csv")

df <- wear_tbl %>% 
  filter(!Maker == "NA") %>%
  mutate(maker_up = toupper(Maker)) %>%
  group_by(maker_up) %>%
  summarise(timesworn = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(timesworn))

df$maker_up <- factor(df$maker_up, levels = df$maker_up[order(df$timesworn)])
df$timesworn <- as.numeric(df$timesworn)
```

To eliminate that step, I can just add one line mutating the maker variable and reordering it based on the number of timesworn. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wear_tbl <- read_csv("../../data/daily_wear.csv")

g <- wear_tbl %>% 
  filter(!Maker == "NA") %>%
  mutate(maker_up = toupper(Maker)) %>%
  group_by(maker_up) %>%
  summarise(timesworn = n()) %>%
  mutate(maker_up = fct_reorder(factor(maker_up), timesworn, .desc = TRUE)) 

g %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=maker_up, y=timesworn)) + 
  geom_point(col="tomato3", size=3) +   # Draw points
  geom_segment(aes(x=maker_up, 
                  xend=maker_up, 
                   y=min(timesworn), 
                   yend=max(timesworn)), 
               linetype="dashed", 
               size=0.1) +   # Draw dashed lines
  labs(title="Number of wears for each maker", 
       subtitle="Sep. 15, 2017 - Dec. 15, 2017", 
       caption="source: me",
       x = "Maker",
       y = "Count") +  
  coord_flip()

```

That's it! The fct_reorder function can also be used with other summary measures as well. I'm going to do my best to make sure that I use this the next time I'm working with factors.
