      <description>Introduction Text scraping Text mining Building the classifier Assessing classifier performance Referencess   Introduction The ways in which people talk about clothing can vary across different sub-populations. On styleforum, the two largest sub-populations are those that are interested in classic menswear versus those that are interested in streetwear. The forum itself is actually divided into these two sides. This posed an interesting question to me to determine if differences in the way that these two sides of the forum discuss clothes could be used to classify posts.</description>

      <description>One of the main draws of Styleforum is it’s “What Are You Wearing Today” thread. In it, users get to show off their clothes in pictures, other users can give “likes” to deem a fit exemplary (if you’ve ever opened up Instagram this concept is probably not too foreign for you). I wanted to see not only which posts were given the most likes in 2017, but I also wanted to download the photo(s) from each fit to upload into a photo album to share with others.</description>

      <description>Styleforum’s “Random fashion thoughts” is one of the most popular sections of the website. It’s a thread where users can talk about almost anything they want regarding clothing and fashion. Every once in awhile the thread gets so long that the moderators opt to close it off and create a new post. The most recent iteration, RFT II, was recently retired so I decided to give myself a weekend project and run some text analysis on it.</description>
