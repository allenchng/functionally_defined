      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of a job hunt for a data science position and that means lots of studying for interviews. To help me study, I&amp;rsquo;ve enlisted the help of friends and family to quiz me by &amp;lsquo;randomly&amp;rsquo; selecting questions from lists. Asking them to scroll through lists though, is somewhat cumbersome and annoying.
With that in mind, I wrote a small Python module that would randomly select interview questions across a number of different categories related to data science and print them one by one to the screen.</description>
