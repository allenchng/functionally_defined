      <description>Like most hobbyists, clothing enthusiasts tend to have strong opinions. In this post I wanted to look at how these opinions changed across time using sentiment analysis and text mining. My dataset of choice was user posts from the Saint Laurent Paris thread on Styleforum. The data was comprised of text from user posts beginning in 2012 and continuing up until today.
As usual, here’s the list of packages used.</description>

      <description>One of the main draws of Styleforum is it’s “What Are You Wearing Today” thread. In it, users get to show off their clothes in pictures, other users can give “likes” to deem a fit exemplary (if you’ve ever opened up Instagram this concept is probably not too foreign for you). I wanted to see not only which posts were given the most likes in 2017, but I also wanted to download the photo(s) from each fit to upload into a photo album to share with others.</description>

      <description>Styleforum’s “Random fashion thoughts” is one of the most popular sections of the website. It’s a thread where users can talk about almost anything they want regarding clothing and fashion. Every once in awhile the thread gets so long that the moderators opt to close it off and create a new post. The most recent iteration, RFT II, was recently retired so I decided to give myself a weekend project and run some text analysis on it.</description>

      <title>Network analysis of my daily clothing choices</title>

      <description>This is a continuation of my previous analysis on tracking preferences in clothing choices (part 1 is here). The inspiration for this post came about after re-reading David Robinson’s network analysis of the movie love actually and realizing that a similar approach could be applied to my sparse network of clothing choices. I found additional help by working through the Network Analysis course on Datacamp.
As per usual, these were the packages used.</description>

      <description>Clothing is one of my hobbies. I spend a fair amount of time thinking, searching for, and talking about clothes with some of my friends. This led me to ask whether I could analyze my own clothing preferences over a period of time starting from Sept. 15 - Dec. 15th. While I’m consciously aware of some of my preferences (I wear a lot of black and clothes from Belgian born designers), I was hoping that I might see other patterns of choices that I had not picked up on.</description>

      <description>Each season of Top Chef is something that I look forward to every year and it’s one of the only shows that my girlfriend and I will make an hour of time for every week to watch. To my delight, this season two of my favorite writers Tom Haberstroh and Kevin Arnovitz have started a weekly podcast called Pack Your Knives to discuss each episode and share their love of Top Chef.</description>
