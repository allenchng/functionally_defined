      <description>Like all programmers, I strive to make my code efficient and easily readable. I hope that the results are somewhat close to those two ideals, but I know that there are always better ways to code things (this xkcd hits alarmingly close to home for me…)

That being said, I’m always happy to stumble into R packages or snippets of code that can help me become more efficient in writing code and I do my best to remind myself to try and use these methods in the future.</description>
