      <description>This summer I had the opportunity to do an internship in data science at the advertising technology company MediaMath. The experience was challenging, educational, and a lot of fun. My project was to investigate methods of probabilistic programming for ad conversion prediction and to deliver a viable method that could be used for production. I also had the chance to write about the outcomes of my work and to be the first post in MediaMath&amp;rsquo;s new data science blog.</description>
