      <description>Introduction Data pre-processing Mapping the data Map customization Refs   Introduction A change of pace! I realized that almost all of my posts thus far have been clothing related, so I decided to pivot and work with another of my interests; fried chicken. Fried chicken is irresistable, and my apartment in Boston is close to a number of korean fried chicken restaurants. For this analysis, I wanted to visualize how a specific chain of korean fried chicken restaurants, Bonchon, were distributed across the United States.</description>

      <description>Introduction Text scraping Text mining Building the classifier Assessing classifier performance Referencess   Introduction The ways in which people talk about clothing can vary across different sub-populations. On styleforum, the two largest sub-populations are those that are interested in classic menswear versus those that are interested in streetwear. The forum itself is actually divided into these two sides. This posed an interesting question to me to determine if differences in the way that these two sides of the forum discuss clothes could be used to classify posts.</description>

      <description>Data Preprocessing Constructing a grid of colors Visualizing color frequencies References   In a preivous post, I visualizled color choices in clothing using slope charts and histograms. This time I wanted to get a bit more creative. In this post I’m going to explore how color frequencies in my clothing choices change across months by using waffle charts.
As usual, to start here’s a list of the packages that I used in this post.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Koundinya Desiraju. This is a place for me to store themes so I have a convenient place to look when I inevitably forget.
library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) library(grid) theme_pub &amp;lt;- function(base_size=10, base_family=&amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;) { library(grid) library(ggthemes) (theme_foundation(base_size=base_size, base_family=base_family) + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;, size = rel(1.2), hjust = 0.5), text = element_text(), panel.background = element_rect(colour = NA), plot.background = element_rect(colour = NA), panel.border = element_rect(colour = NA), axis.title = element_text(face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;, size = rel(1)), axis.</description>

      <description>Like all programmers, I strive to make my code efficient and easily readable. I hope that the results are somewhat close to those two ideals, but I know that there are always better ways to code things (this xkcd hits alarmingly close to home for me…)
(source: xkcd)
That being said, I’m always happy to stumble into R packages or snippets of code that can help me become more efficient in writing code and I do my best to remind myself to try and use these methods in the future.</description>

      <description>This is the 3rd part of my analysis on daily clothing choices (part 1 and part 2). In this post I’m going to be testing out the the threejs package and creating interactive networks using the graphjs function. I will also be using David Robinson’s gganimate package to create an animated timeline of my clothing choices.
As usual, here’s the packages used.</description>

      <description>Like most hobbyists, clothing enthusiasts tend to have strong opinions. In this post I wanted to look at how these opinions changed across time using sentiment analysis and text mining. My dataset of choice was user posts from the Saint Laurent Paris thread on Styleforum. The data was comprised of text from user posts beginning in 2012 and continuing up until today.
As usual, here’s the list of packages used.</description>

      <description>One of the main draws of Styleforum is it’s “What Are You Wearing Today” thread. In it, users get to show off their clothes in pictures, other users can give “likes” to deem a fit exemplary (if you’ve ever opened up Instagram this concept is probably not too foreign for you). I wanted to see not only which posts were given the most likes in 2017, but I also wanted to download the photo(s) from each fit to upload into a photo album to share with others.</description>

      <guid>/posts/text-scraping-styleforum-s-random-fashion-thoughts-thread/</guid>
      <description>Styleforum’s “Random fashion thoughts” is one of the most popular sections of the website. It’s a thread where users can talk about almost anything they want regarding clothing and fashion. Every once in awhile the thread gets so long that the moderators opt to close it off and create a new post. The most recent iteration, RFT II, was recently retired so I decided to give myself a weekend project and run some text analysis on it.</description>

      <description>This is a continuation of my previous analysis on tracking preferences in clothing choices (part 1 is here). The inspiration for this post came about after re-reading David Robinson’s network analysis of the movie love actually and realizing that a similar approach could be applied to my sparse network of clothing choices. I found additional help by working through the Network Analysis course on Datacamp.
As per usual, these were the packages used.</description>

      <description>Clothing is one of my hobbies. I spend a fair amount of time thinking, searching for, and talking about clothes with some of my friends. This led me to ask whether I could analyze my own clothing preferences over a period of time starting from Sept. 15 - Dec. 15th. While I’m consciously aware of some of my preferences (I wear a lot of black and clothes from Belgian born designers), I was hoping that I might see other patterns of choices that I had not picked up on.</description>

      <description>Each season of Top Chef is something that I look forward to every year and it’s one of the only shows that my girlfriend and I will make an hour of time for every week to watch. To my delight, this season two of my favorite writers Tom Haberstroh and Kevin Arnovitz have started a weekly podcast called Pack Your Knives to discuss each episode and share their love of Top Chef.</description>

      <description>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston University. Inside the lab, I think about why humans learn differently from one another. Outside the lab, I scour the internet for vintage clothes and eat as much Korean fried chicken as I can afford after buying vintage clothes.
This site is a work in progress, so please forgive any and all broken things.</description>
