      <description>I recently completed
Here’s the list of packages used..
library(rvest) library(tidyverse) library(stringr) library(tidytext) library(broom) library(lubridate) library(tm) library(igraph) library(ggraph) theme_set(theme_bw()) The first step was to pull text from all posts in the Saint Laurent Paris thread. If you’ve read my previous analyses, this follows the same scraping procedure as I’ve outlined in my random fashion thoughts post and my what are you wearing today post.

      <description>One of the main draws of Styleforum is it’s “What Are You Wearing Today” thread. In it, users get to show off their clothes in pictures, other users can give “likes” to deem a fit exemplary (if you’ve ever opened up Instagram this concept is probably not too foreign for you). I wanted to see not only which posts were given the most likes in 2017, but I also wanted to download the photo(s) from each fit to upload into a photo album to share with others.</description>

      <description>Styleforum’s “Random fashion thoughts” is one of the most popular sections of the website. It’s a thread where users can talk about almost anything they want regarding clothing and fashion. Every once in awhile the thread gets so long that the moderators opt to close it off and create a new post. The most recent iteration, RFT II, was recently retired so I decided to give myself a weekend project and run some text analysis on it.</description>

      <title>Network analysis of my daily clothing choices</title>

      <description>This is a continuation of my previous analysis on tracking preferences in clothing choices (part 1 is here). The inspiration for this post came about after re-reading David Robinson’s network analysis of the movie love actually and realizing that a similar approach could be applied to my sparse network of clothing choices. I found additional help by working through the Network Analysis course on Datacamp.
As per usual, these were the packages used.</description>

      <description>Clothing is one of my hobbies. I spend a fair amount of time thinking, searching for, and talking about clothes with some of my friends. This led me to ask whether I could analyze my own clothing preferences over a period of time starting from Sept. 15 - Dec. 15th. While I’m consciously aware of some of my preferences (I wear a lot of black and clothes from Belgian born designers), I was hoping that I might see other patterns of choices that I had not picked up on.</description>

      <description>Each season of Top Chef is something that I look forward to every year and it’s one of the only shows that my girlfriend and I will make an hour of time for every week to watch. To my delight, this season two of my favorite writers Tom Haberstroh and Kevin Arnovitz have started a weekly podcast called Pack Your Knives to discuss each episode and share their love of Top Chef.</description>

      <description>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston University. Inside the lab, I think about why humans learn differently from one another. Outside the lab, I scour the internet for vintage clothes and eat as much Korean fried chicken as I can afford after buying vintage clothes.
This site is a work in progress, so please forgive any and all broken things.</description>
