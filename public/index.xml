      <description>Clothing is one of my hobbies. I spend a fair amount of time thinking, searching for, and talking about clothes with some of my friends. This led me to ask whether I could analyze my own clothing preferences over a period of time starting from Sept. 15 - Dec. 15th. While I’m consciously aware of some of my preferences (I wear a lot of black and clothes from Belgian born designers), I was hoping that I might see other patterns of choices that I had not picked up on.</description>

      <description>Each season of Top Chef is something that I look forward to every year and it’s one of the only shows that my girlfriend and I will make an hour of time for every week to watch. To my delight, this season two of my favorite writers Tom Haberstroh and Kevin Arnovitz have started a weekly podcast called Pack Your Knives to discuss each episode and share their love of Top Chef.</description>

      <description>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston University. Inside the lab, I think about why humans learn differently from one another. Outside the lab, I scour the internet for vintage clothes and eat as much Korean fried chicken as I can afford after buying vintage clothes.
This site is a work in progress, so please forgive any and all broken things.</description>
